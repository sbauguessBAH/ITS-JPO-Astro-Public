                        <h2>2014 Report to Congress</h2>
	<h4>The Intelligent Transportation Systems 
	  <br />
	  Program Advisory Committee<br />
	  2014 Report to Congress </h4>
	<h3>1. Overview</h3>
	<ul>
	  <li>Pursuant to Section 53003 of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21), this report describes how the U.S. Department of Transportation (Department) has implemented recommendations made by the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Program Advisory Committee (ITS PAC) in 2013. </li>
	  <li>The Secretary was directed, initially in the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act:  A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) and again in MAP-21, to establish the Committee with no more than 20 members to provide advice to the Secretary on ITS aspects of the Department’s strategic plan and on ITS research funding.  The Secretary is directed also to submit a report to Congress not later than February 1 of each year that includes the following:
	    <ul>
	      <li>all recommendations made by the Committee during the preceding calendar year;</li>
	      <li>an explanation of the manner in which the Secretary has implemented those recommendations; and</li>
	      <li>for recommendations not implemented, the reasons for rejecting the recommendations.</li>
	      </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>In response to the legislative directive, the Secretary established the ITS PAC in 2006.  Since its inception, the ITS PAC has met 17 times and has submitted 6 advice memoranda to the Secretary.</li>
	  </ul>
	<h3>2. ITSPAC Activity in 2013</h3>
	<p>The ITS PAC held three meetings that  focused on subcommittee deliberations and progress briefings on their assigned  ITS research program evaluation topics.  As needed, the subcommittees engaged outside experts and ITS Joint  Program Office (JPO) staff in the process of developing their recommendations. Following wide-ranging discussions and  debate, the ITS PAC reached consensus on 20 recommendations to help improve the  ITS research program in the critical areas of security framework, technology  strategy, global harmonization of standards, and outreach communications and promotion  plan. The ITS PAC submitted its  recommendations in a December 20, 2013, advice memorandum to the  Department. The Department carefully  considered the ITS PAC&rsquo;s advice and responded, describing the Department&rsquo;s  implementation of the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations. The ITS PAC&rsquo;s recommendations and the  Department&rsquo;s response are included in paragraph 3 below.</p>
    <h3>3. ITSPAC Recommendations and Department Response</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Security Framework</strong></li>
      </ul>
    <p><strong>Background</strong>: Communications security is a rapidly evolving  challenge. Every day new viruses and new  forms of attack are invented. It is  critical that the security framework of Connected Vehicles allows for  flexibility and evolution, and constant vigilance be exercised. </p>
    <p>The Security Framework Subcommittee  of the ITS PAC has become aware of independent research regarding potential  vulnerability in the Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) communications  construct. While the committee&rsquo;s scope  and expertise does not allow us to assess the validity of the research or the  severity of the vulnerabilities, we believe that it is important for the ITS  JPO to similarly be made aware of this research.</p>
    <p>Specifically, the ITS PAC Security  Subcommittee has received independent research on the proposed Institute of Electrical  and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)  1609.2 Security Services for Applications and Management Messages. This research found several potential  opportunities to improve the system&rsquo;s performance and security. First, the current protocol lacks support for  a mechanism to allow root authorities to change keys, as well as for the  Security Credentials Management System (SCMS) Manager to change signature  algorithms. Developing a solution to  this finding should be high priority due to its impact on the scale of the  SCMS. In addition, the research finds  that this protocol may be subject to misbinding attacks, which should be  considered a practical attack and the protocol revised to enhance resiliency  much like other similar protocols such as Transport Layer Security, Internet  Protocol Security. In addition, the  research finds a potential susceptibility to worm-hole attacks, which also  should be studied.</p>
    <p><strong>Recommendation 1</strong>. The ITS  JPO should establish a mechanism to allow entities not directly involved in  Federal or automaker developments in the security aspects of DSRC to be able to  provide input to the JPO process. This  input could be in the form of a briefing request from the ITS JPO or Office of  the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology (OST-R), a solicitation for  comments, a public forum for discussion, contractor analysis, public-private  partnership, or other means the ITS JPO deems appropriate.</p>
    <p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to Recommendation 1.</strong> The Department concurs. The ITS JPO has established two mechanisms  for other interested parties to participate in the development of the security  aspects of connected vehicles that use DSRC and other communication media. First, we are developing a project in  Southeast Michigan (Southeast Michigan 2014 project - - <a href="http://www.its.dot.gov/testbed/testbed_SEmichigan.htm">http://www.its.dot.gov/testbed/testbed_SEmichigan.htm</a>) where we will be exploring communication security  issues. All are welcome to make use of  that facility and comment on the practices we are exploring. That project will provide the communication  infrastructure for the upcoming ITS World Congress 2014 event  demonstrations. Also, we have started  the Affiliated Test Beds <a href="http://www.its.dot.gov/testbed/testbed_affiliated.htm">http://www.its.dot.gov/testbed/testbed_affiliated.htm</a> to allow outside parties to perform collaborative research with us. We have two communication security companies  outside of the auto industry that are participating in that activity.</p>
    <p><strong>Background</strong>: The United States does not have a specific federal  regulation establishing universal implementation of privacy policies. Congress has, at times, considered  comprehensive laws regulating the collection of information online, such as the  Consumer Internet Privacy Enhancement Act and the Online Privacy Protection Act  of 2001, but none have been enacted. The  United States prefers what it calls a 'sectoral' approach to data protection  legislation, which relies on a combination of legislation, regulation, and  self-regulation, rather than governmental regulation alone. Privacy, at both the federal level and state  levels, is regulated by specific industry and type of use in 23 areas, with  non-mandatory guidelines that recommend industry self-regulation.</p>
    <p><strong>Recommendation 2</strong>. The ITS  JPO should work with industry and policymakers to develop a Privacy Guideline  for Vehicle Data and Content, utilizing best practices from other sectors where  appropriate. However, there may be a  number of fundamental issues that must be addressed first such as data  ownership, metadata policies, and self-regulation, among others.</p>
    <p>We recommend outreach and  collaboration with automotive, telecommunication and computation industries,  consumer and motorist organizations, and other potential stakeholders and  experts to provide input and/or review of the guideline.</p>
    <p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to Recommendation 2</strong>. The Department concurs. Consumer privacy protection in a Connected  Vehicle environment is of primary concern to the Department. The ITS JPO has worked with its modal  partners to ensure that appropriate privacy protections have been designed into  ITS JPO funded vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I)  concept designs and architectures. We also have ensured that privacy  impact assessments have been performed for all systems procured in connection  with research efforts, as required by law. The ITS JPO is committed to  working with its modal partners and the Department&rsquo;s Privacy Office to assess  the privacy impacts of any systems developed for implementation through its  research. The ITS JPO also intends to continue facilitating the ongoing  dialogue between the Department and a wide variety of connected vehicle  stakeholders around privacy, and working with its modal partners and the  Department&rsquo;s Privacy Office to explore additional Department actions that could  help protect consumer privacy, including issuance of potential Guidelines. </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Technology Strategy</strong></li>
      </ul>
    <p><strong>Background</strong>: The communication of trusted data between vehicles of  all types on the nation&rsquo;s roadways is a basic tenet of a successful Connected  Vehicle safety system deployment. Data  from misbehaving vehicles, or roadside equipment that causes or initiates the  possibility of inappropriate driver responses could damage the trustworthiness  and effectiveness of the system to avoid crashes. For example, with inaccurate Global Positioning  System (GPS) positional reporting from one or more  vehicles in a region, false warnings indicating phantom slowing or stopped  vehicles in a lane could result. On the  other hand, an inaccurate report of the lateral position of a stopped vehicle  may prevent the appropriate warning in a following vehicle. Many instances of such behavior would lose  trust from the participating drivers and the effectiveness of the system would  be significantly reduced.</p>
    <p>There are at least two significant  operational modes for misbehavior: one would be operational deficiencies in the  installed equipment (non-malicious) and another would be the purposeful  injection of messaging that indicates inaccurate description of the true  physical scenario (malicious).</p>
    <p><strong>Recommendation 3</strong>. The ITS  JPO should conduct a study to determine the likelihood of false detections  given the minimum positioning performance requirements set in place for a  possible regulation or New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) certification, and  quantify statistical anomaly vs. misbehavior which should be flagged.</p>
    <p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to Recommendation 3</strong>. The Department concurs. Data gathered from the Safety Pilot Model  Deployment and follow-on activities will be analyzed to help update minimum  performance requirements for devices participating in crash avoidance  applications. Understanding the location  of a vehicle is one of the most important performance requirements. Analysis of some of the early samples of the  data has shown that the devices used are likely to be adequate in this respect. It has also pointed out some unexpected cases  where outside factors may be adversely impacting the operation of the devices  that was not anticipated. </p>
    <p><strong>Recommendation 4</strong>. In the  case where a detection of misbehaving devices occurs, the ITS JPO should identify  the technical issue and policy actions to be taken to keep the user trust at a  level that supports the benefit/cost ratios calculated for deployment. </p>
    <p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to Recommendation 4</strong>. The Department concurs. Efficient  revocation and/or quarantining of malfunctioning and misbehaving devices will  be an important area of research in the near future.</p>
    <p><strong>Background</strong>: This topic concerns  commercial vehicle regulations and is not directly within the ITS JPO&rsquo;s  responsibility, but the Committee chose to comment on this broader Department  issue under its extended charter provisions.</p>
    <p>In  2014, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Federal  Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) will consider the same vehicle safety message communication  rulemaking for interstate commercial vehicles.  There are definite advantages to deploying in the commercial vehicle  environment. After initial  implementation, within a few years many commercial vehicles, including  retrofitted existing vehicles, could provide data on performance, robustness,  security and viability to support evaluation of passenger vehicle efficacy. Commercial vehicle interior space for device  placement, and antenna shape and placement are not as constrained as they are  for passenger vehicles. And with  vehicle-to-any device (V2X) implemented in commercial vehicles, the incremental  cost to include vehicle diagnostics, driver behavior monitoring, trailer  integrity, road condition, weather and traffic awareness is now a simpler  business decision, and we should see a broad adoption of those capabilities. Suitable quid  pro quo arrangements with commercial vehicle operators are then possible  for U.S. DOT, state and local agencies to harvest the mobility information. Meanwhile, public awareness, technology  refinement, value proposition and ability to address security issues are now  accelerated in a controlled environment of long haul truckers.</p>
    <p><strong>Recommendation 5</strong>. FMCSA and  NHTSA should pursue Interstate Commercial Vehicle Rulemaking for both V2V  Safety Messages and V2X capabilities.</p>
    <p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to Recommendation 5</strong>. The Department concurs. NHTSA will issue a regulatory decision in  2014 for new heavy-duty vehicles similar to the recently announced decision to  pursue rulemaking for V2V light vehicles.  Any other rulemaking by the Department regarding trucks will need to  wait for these decisions to be announced.</p>
    <p><strong>Background</strong>: Positioning system performance, accuracy and reliability,  will be critical to Connected Vehicle operations. While the Committee understands that  extensive testing has been done on positioning, the ITS JPO needs to ensure  that this technology will not affect successful deployment and operation and be  achievable at acceptable cost.</p>
    <p><strong>Recommendation 6</strong>. The ITS  JPO should ensure that adequate testing of positioning system performance is  conducted in all expected conditions and that cases where positioning  performance will not be adequate are well understood and their likelihood of  occurrence calculated and potential impact on vehicle interactions  understood. Furthermore, successful  positioning performance must be achievable at acceptable component costs and  the performance/cost tradeoffs should be analyzed.</p>
    <p><strong>Department&rsquo;s  Response to Recommendation 6</strong>. The Department concurs. Samples of data gathered from the Safety  Pilot Model Deployment and follow-on activities are being prepared for  performance requirement studies.  Different analysis capabilities are being investigated.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Global Harmonization of Standards</strong></li>
      </ul>
    <p><strong>Background</strong>: The Global  Harmonization of Standards Subcommittee was formed to provide recommendations  on effective ways to ensure that ITS standards are harmonized globally in order  to promote the efficient and rapid deployment of ITS technologies and to  minimize the cost and complexity of maintaining those standards once they are  deployed. The Subcommittee agreed that a  wide range of stakeholder groups will need to work together to ensure that a  necessary and beneficial level of harmonization occurs including governments,  vehicle manufacturers, other ITS-related industries, trade associations, and  relevant standards organizations. The  Subcommittee recognizes that significant progress has been made in harmonization  since the last ITS PAC report in 2011. However,  continued strong leadership to encourage harmonization is needed to enable the  use of common hardware and/or software modules across multiple regions, and in  this area technology expertise is critical.  The Subcommittee believes that standards need not be identical for there  to be tangible benefits and that not all standards need to be globally  harmonized, only those where there are common international markets. </p>
    <p>The following obstacles to global harmonization have been  identified:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Competition among certain standards  organizations working to develop similar standards.</li>
      <li>European governments, automobile manufacturers  and infrastructure suppliers/operators are driving short initial deployment  timing with significant voluntary resources from the European manufacturers and  financial support from the European Union on standards development. The U.S. must fortify their international  standardization participation to mitigate the risk that early stage technologies  based on non-harmonized standards be adopted locally in Europe, which may make  the adoption of harmonized multiregional standards more difficult in the longer  term.</li>
      <li>Although multiple forums with interests in  harmonized standards exist and some progress has been made towards this end,  sufficient cohesive processes and/or appropriate integrative forums to  facilitate harmonization of specific standards are currently lacking.</li>
      <li>Lack of agreement among vehicle manufacturers  and governments concerning the scope and timing of harmonization needs.</li>
      <li>Lack of understanding of the level of  harmonization necessary to be beneficial.</li>
      </ul>
    <p><strong>Recommendation 7.</strong> ITS  JPO and other organizations within the Department should continue to identify  harmonization of ITS standards as a critical priority in their public  communications about ITS technologies and continue to include it in their  strategic plans. While ITS JPO has in  the past made such statements as part of its outreach programs, reinforcement  from higher levels within the Department, the Department of Commerce, and the  White House would be of substantial value.  Other regions are invested at these levels of authority; the U.S.  government should be as well. 
</p>
    <p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to Recommendation 7</strong>. The Department concurs that high level  reinforcement of the benefits of internationally harmonized standards by key  U.S. policy leaders is valuable and desirable.  The Department has continued to publicly reinforce our commitment to  internationally harmonized high-quality standards and has cooperated with the  Department of Commerce via the National Institute of Standards and Technology  (NIST) to disseminate our messages. The  Department will continue to seek appropriate cooperation from the White House,  NIST, and other Federal organizations in publicly reaffirming both the value of,  and our commitment to international standards harmonization. Standards harmonization will continue to  remain a key focus area in the next Departmental ITS Strategic Plan which is  currently being developed.
      </p>
    <p><strong>Recommendation 8</strong>. ITS  JPO should continue to adequately fund organizations and programs acting to  harmonize ITS standards. Sufficient  funding should be made available to effectively deploy U.S. experts from the U.S.  Government, automobile manufacturers, and relevant organizations to the  appropriate forums working on ITS standards.  In the case of federally funded organizations, the ITS JPO should fully  exercise contractual/grant authority to encourage harmonization. 
      </p>
    <p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to Recommendation 8</strong>. The Department concurs with this  recommendation and is acting accordingly within resource and policy  constraints. The Department intends to  continue to provide limited travel funding support for voluntary industry experts  participating in standards harmonization efforts along with executing needed  work via more traditional means, including Standards Development Organizations  (SDOs), technical support contracts and cooperative agreements with industry,  to expeditiously meet Connected Vehicle standardization needs. Recently initiated contracts with SDOs  explicitly call out harmonization activities and make funding available to  execute them. To further support  harmonization, we have sought cooperation from ITS JPO funded research programs  to support and fund researcher participation in appropriate standards working  groups and we have developed appropriate contracting language to facilitate  such participation. While we recognize  that personal &ndash; and in-person &ndash; participation in consensus-based standards  development efforts remains critical to assuring that U.S. interests are fully  represented in effective standards development efforts, resource and travel  policy restrictions will likely continue to impact such participation by  Federal staff for the foreseeable future.
      </p>
    <p><strong>Recommendation 9.</strong> The  ITS JPO should assure that the U.S. &ndash; European Union (EU) Standards  Harmonization Working Group (WG) and any future U.S.&ndash;regional collaborations  working on harmonized standards are properly supported by both U.S. government  and industry personnel who are actively engaged in standards work.  Further, these groups should meet face-to-face on a frequent basis and for  periods of sufficient duration to allow thorough discussion and resolution of  pertinent issues. Additionally, the U.S.  should work to consolidate the various regional groups with interests in  standards harmonization into a single global working group. 
      </p>
    <p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to Recommendation 9</strong>. The Department concurs with this  recommendation and is acting accordingly within resource and policy  constraints. Both the frequency and  duration of U.S. &ndash; EU Standards Harmonization WG meetings are subject to  agreement by both the U.S. and EU. These  meetings are co-led by U.S. Federal staff, and to the extent that domestic or  international travel is required, meeting frequency and duration is governed by  Departmental and organizational travel policies as well as staff  availability. Going forward, we will  seek to maintain a frequency of at least semi-annual public meetings adjacent  to other events with substantial stakeholder participation, with equitable  location distribution between the U.S. and EU and remote participation  opportunities. It should be noted that  the ability to execute a Harmonization Action Plan (HAP) or other cooperative  work items remains dependent upon our international partners&rsquo; willingness and  ability to act along with the Department and industry partners.
      </p>
    <p><strong>Recommendation 10</strong>. The  ITS JPO should cooperate with industry and others to develop a list of key  Connected Vehicle interfaces and standards required to support broad Connected  Vehicles deployment and identify and aggressively pursue beneficial  harmonization and multiregional joint standards development opportunities. The progress of these standards can then be  tracked through the various standards organizations and pressure applied to  ensure that they are being developed in a harmonized fashion and the  development of redundant standards discouraged. 
      </p>
    <p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to Recommendation 10</strong>. The Department concurs with this  recommendation and is acting accordingly.  A Connected Vehicle Reference Implementation Architecture (CVRIA) is  under development with broad domestic and international stakeholder input from  industry, academia, and government. The  CVRIA will be used to identify candidate interfaces for standardization and to  support development of a prioritized connected vehicle standardization plan,  again with broad stakeholder input.  These candidate interfaces will be aligned to the extent practical with  those in other global connected vehicle architectures to the extent that these  are known and documented in order to facilitate standards harmonization. As part of the analysis, interfaces will be  evaluated, standards gaps will be identified, and opportunities to adopt or  adapt existing standards as well as needs for new standards development  identified. When in the public interest,  the Department will seek to harmonize needed standards. For example, in cases where both the U.S. and  another region such as the EU have identified identical or similar interfaces  in their architectures for which no suitable standards currently exists, we  will seek to cooperatively adapt or develop a single harmonized standard to  cover such an interface. In addition to  opening this process to the aforementioned broad stakeholder input, we are also  seeking to perform the required gap analysis cooperatively with the EU under  our existing cooperation agreement and to open this effort to other  regions/nations interested in cooperating. 
      </p>
    <p><strong>Recommendation 11</strong>. The  ITS JPO should ensure that the intellectual property and patent rights embedded  in existing and emerging standards are clearly understood and develop a plan to  mitigate the impact of these issues on Connected Vehicle implementation.
      </p>
    <p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to Recommendation 11</strong>. The Department agrees that intellectual  property and patent rights embedded in existing and emerging standards should  be clearly understandable. As directed  by legislation, we cooperate with Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) to  facilitate development and publication of standards. SDO&rsquo;s intellectual property policies apply to  these standards; the Department does not have any specific authority to enforce  or dictate what these policies are. The  extent to which essential intellectual property might be incorporated in any  specific standard is determined by the collective expert judgment of the participants  in each standards working group in accordance with the SDO&rsquo;s consensus/voting  procedures.
      </p>
    <p><strong>Recommendation 12</strong>. The  ITS JPO should continue to consider the relationship between Connected Vehicle  standards and emerging standards for new technologies, including  machine-to-machine communication, necessary to support automated/autonomous  vehicle deployment to ensure that Connected Vehicle standards evolve to meet  the needs of these developing technologies as well. 
      </p>
    <p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response  to Recommendation 12</strong>. The Department  concurs with this recommendation and is acting accordingly. For example, OST-R has become an Associate  Member of the oneM2M global standards development consortium on behalf of the  Department, and we continue to monitor and appropriately participate in oneM2M  activities to help ensure that U.S. ITS standardization interests are well  represented. The analysis of candidate  interfaces for standardization following the CVRIA effort will broadly seek out  appropriate standards from global sources as candidates for adoption/adaption  to meet Connected Vehicle interface needs.  Via technical support services contracts and standards working group  participation, we seek to remain aware of technological and standardization  developments in other industries/fields which might be of benefit to ITS. Further, ITS standards working groups themselves  often include experts with broad expertise and do facilitate substantial  knowledge transfer to benefit ITS standardization. We recognize the importance of globally  harmonized standards, test procedures, and certification processes to  facilitate the efficient introduction of automated/autonomous vehicle  technologies and we are currently formulating our program plan to address these  and other automated/autonomous vehicle research needs.
      </p>
    <p><strong>Recommendation 13</strong>. The  ITS JPO should continue efforts to pursue global harmonization of 5.9 Gigahertz (GHz)  radio spectrum standards to meet the needs of low-latency, secured Connected  Vehicle communications. The ITS JPO  should closely monitor and participate in spectrum usage testing to ensure that  that no changes are made unless thorough  data-driven review testing demonstrates that no harmful interference would  occur to the existing frequency allocation. The U.S. DOT and the Federal Communication  Commission (FCC) should collaborate in reaching the right decision on this  matter.</p>
    <p><strong>Department&rsquo;s  Response to Recommendation 13</strong>. The Department agrees that global harmonization of the  5.9 GHz radio spectrum would facilitate harmonized standards and common hardware  and software to support connected vehicle deployments and will continue to  call-out these benefits in appropriate forums.  We continue to monitor and participate in standards working group  activity associated with evaluation of proposed spectrum sharing and  development of candidate approaches, and will continue to participate in regulatory  processes via appropriate channels.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Outreach Communications and Promotion Plan</strong></li>
      </ul>
    <p><strong>Background</strong>: Success  of Connected Vehicle deployment is inextricably linked to consumer awareness of  and buy-in to the benefits of the new technology. Such awareness, acceptance and enthusiasm  will be a key factor in the speed of deployment, whether that is replacing  older, non-equipped vehicles or buying and installing approved aftermarket  devices. This program starts with developing  a broad-based communications plan targeting multiple areas including  stakeholders and audiences, internal, external, public, private, and multiple  levels of government. This plan is  needed considering the NHTSA rulemaking decision in 2014 concerning light  vehicles and the FCC decision on spectrum sharing. Implementation solutions, particularly  regarding possible aftermarket solutions, will need to be clearly described  along with implementation benefits.</p>
    <p><strong>Recommendation  14</strong>. The ITS JPO should engage  communication professionals to develop an overarching communications strategy,  and aggressively launch an effective public communications campaign.</p>
    <p><strong>Department&rsquo;s  Response to Recommendation 14</strong>. The Department  concurs and is acting accordingly within the bounds of its legislative mandate,  which is limited to communications and outreach to advance research and  technology transfer. Ultimately,  consumer awareness of the benefits of connected vehicle capabilities must be a  shared responsibility among the many partners involved in advancing these  systems.</p>
    <p><strong>Recommendation  15</strong>. NHTSA should create a  comprehensive document on safety benefits, particularly as new technologies are  being introduced that improve the safety of vehicles. NHTSA cited such a document on Connected  Vehicle benefits when voicing support for Connected Vehicles in May 2012.</p>
    <p><strong>Department&rsquo;s  Response to Recommendation 15</strong>. The Department partially concurs. NHTSA routinely  releases safety information regarding new vehicle technology when it has  confidence in the results, rather than compiling comprehensive reports  regarding multiple technologies. In addition, withholding results to  compile a comprehensive list would delay the public release of information. For connected vehicles, as NHTSA has stated,  it will evaluate the potential safety benefits of this technology and release  that information as soon as it is ready. The Department will continue to  be cognizant of current and future technologies and release information on  safety benefits when such analyses are appropriate.

    <p><strong>Recommendation 16</strong>. The ITS  JPO should create a Glossary of Terms as part of the Strategic Plan. The ITS Connected Vehicles program would  benefit from greater attention to nomenclature.  Activities, programs, and technologies should be identified with unique  terms that have clear and stable meanings.  Every attempt should be made to use terms consistently and to encourage  consistent use in the ITS community.</p>
    <p>We identify two general areas where  nomenclature is especially important.  The first is in technology. Terms  like &ldquo;V2V&rsquo;, &ldquo;automated vehicles,&rdquo; &ldquo;autonomous vehicles,&rdquo; and &ldquo;driverless cars&rdquo; should  be defined and used consistently. </p>
    <p>The second area is in  deployment. Terms like &ldquo;adoption,&rdquo;  &ldquo;implementation,&rdquo; and &ldquo;deployment&rdquo; should also be clearly defined and  consistently used. Clarity of terms may  make clearer how new technologies will transition into use.</p>
    <p>Since there is widespread use of  these various terms by different sectors such as academia, industry, the press,  the public and others, it not likely that the ITS JPO can drive a common  lexicon, but at least for the purposes of its own generated documents this  glossary can serve to clarify the discussion.</p>
    <p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to Recommendation 16</strong>. The Department concurs. This is  planned to be featured as an appendix to the Strategic Plan. Definitions  will be drawn from sources like the NHTSA Decision (once available), the Government  Accountability Office (GAO) report, the American Association of State Highway and  Transportation Officials (AASHTO)  Footprint Analysis, the National Cooperative  Highway Research Program (NCHRP)  Cost-Benefit Analysis, as well as from our research work with industry partners  to include the Crash Avoidance Metrics Partnership (CAMP) and the Vehicle  Infrastructure Integration Consortium (VIIC) and through our international  cooperation efforts.</p>
    <p><strong>Recommendation 17</strong>. The Department  should encourage and incentivize additional DSRC pilot deployments at the state  and local level (rural, urban and regional).  Such DSRC pilots would educate local officials and local publics about  the benefits of DSRC-based systems.  Multi-modalism is a desirable feature of such pilots.</p>
    <p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to Recommendation 17</strong>. The Department concurs and is planning to  launch a Connected Vehicle pilot program that will focus on a host of  transportation applications to include: mobility, road-weather, freight,  emergency first responder, environmental, and other transportation management  applications. This program is envisioned to be multi-modal in nature,  include the use of DSRC technology, and funds a series of projects at various  locations around the country. A Request for Information (RFI) was  released in late January to gather information from stakeholders regarding this  activity. More information will be  forthcoming in 2014 once all RFI responses have been analyzed.</p>
    <p><strong>Background</strong>: Implementation &ndash; be it of ITS or any other innovation &ndash;  involves an understanding of local operating conditions. Innovation studies have identified two models  of innovation: a local/incremental  model and a laboratory/advanced model.  Both models are important. </p>
    <p>The federal ITS program excels at the  laboratory/advanced model. Yet many ITS  implementations are local in origination.  An example of this might be electronic toll collection. U.S. DOT should develop mechanisms to support  the local/incremental model of innovation.</p>
    <p><strong>Recommendation 18</strong>. The ITS  JPO should continue its efforts to connect Federal and state and local agencies. Given their key role in ITS implementation,  state and local officials should have the most effective voice possible in U.S.  DOT technology programs. Hierarchical  federal program structures should be complemented by peer-to-peer program  structures (AASHTO and Traffic Management Center (TMC) operators association),  and both types of programs should connect.</p>
    <p>Federal programs should continue to  seek ways to connect with state and local peer-to-peer associations and with  non-traditional stakeholders such as National Association of Counties,  Conference of Mayors, League of Cities, and Governors Association). Outreach to deployers should focus on ready-to-deploy  technologies.</p>
    <p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to Recommendation 18</strong>. The Department concurs. The  ITS JPO often partners with state and local agencies to field test and  demonstrate different ITS solutions. Just recently, the ITS JPO released  a procurement to provide Integrated Corridor Management Deployment Planning  grants to state and local agencies to support the concept development and  analysis of integrated corridor management solutions for different communities.  The ITS JPO also partners with the state DOT-led pooled fund studies to support  the analysis of ITS solutions. Most recently, we provided funding to a ten  state partner pooled fund study to look at connected vehicle applications that  apply to intersections. In the coming  year, we are looking to add outreach to new stakeholder groups such as those  mentioned above.</p>
    <p><strong>Background</strong>: NHTSA rule-making procedures offer an excellent  framework for continued progress toward Connected Vehicle implementation. The Connected Vehicle program has gone from  the lab to the field test, and now the challenge is to advance it to widespread  implementation. Although initial  development has been led by the public sector, final implementation will occur  in the private sector. The NHTSA  proceedings provide a useful venue for all stakeholders to interact and to  articulate and evaluate their commitment to Connected Vehicle implementation.</p>
    <p><strong>Recommendation 19</strong>. U.S. DOT  should further its capacity to identify and to promote local innovations. U.S. DOT should provide seed grants and other  support for successful innovations, even if they originate outside of the  federal program.</p>
    <p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to Recommendation 19</strong>. The  Department concurs and plans to continue to expand opportunities for private  sector and state and local agencies to participate in Connected Vehicle testing  and development through expansion of test beds and pilot testing wherein  Connected Vehicle innovations can be vetted for efficacy and interoperability. </p>
    <p><strong>Background</strong>: The best-known  DSRC-necessary Apps are those in the Safety Pilot demonstration. We believe there are additional  DSRC-necessary apps that will yield additional benefits. By identifying as many apps as possible in  this category, the JPO will more fully identify the benefits of DSRC. Moreover, by identifying DSRC-necessary Apps  that function even without significant market penetration, JPO can highlight  applications with nearer-term benefits than some of the safety apps.</p>
    <p><strong>Recommendation 20</strong>. When reporting on the Connected Vehicle  program the ITS JPO should use the analytical category &ldquo;DSRC-necessary  Apps&rdquo;. DSRC-necessary Apps are  application-layer programs whose functioning demands the characteristics of the  DRSC network (high speed, security, privacy, no subscriber fee, and no opt-in). </p>
    <p>ITS JPO should identify all known  or planned DSRC-necessary apps. It  should seek to stimulate further development of such applications. DSRC-necessary apps that can operate in (near)  stand-alone mode should be identified.</p>
    <p><strong>Department&rsquo;s  Response to Recommendation 20</strong>. The Department partially concurs. Identifying application categories might be  more appropriate since there will be many variations on particular  applications. Likely DSRC necessary  application categories would include multi-vehicle crash avoidance  applications, signalized intersection crash avoidance applications, commercial  vehicle inspection or enforcement support applications. All of these categories of applications could  operate in (near) stand-alone mode. All  include the need to communicate with a (rapidly) moving vehicle. Most other application categories can be  accomplished by multiple communication media.
