	<h2>2012 Report to Congress</h2>
    <h4>United States Department of Transportation<br />
	  2012 Intelligent Transportation Systems<br />
	  Program Advisory Committee<br />
	  Report to Congress</h4>
    <h4>1. Overview</h4>
    <ul start="1" type="a">
      <li>a. Pursuant       to Section 5305(h) of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible Efficient       Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU, P.L. 109-59),       this report describes how the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT or       Department) has implemented recommendations made by the Intelligent       Transportation Systems (ITS) Program Advisory Committee (ITS PAC) in 2011.    </li>
    </ul>
    <ul start="2" type="a">
      <li>b. The       SAFETEA-LU directs the Department to establish an Advisory Committee with       no more than 20 members to provide advice to the Secretary of       Transportation on the scope and direction of the Department&rsquo;s ITS Program       by providing input into the development of the ITS aspects of the Department&rsquo;s       strategic plan and by reviewing ITS research being considered for       funding.&nbsp; The Department is also       directed to submit an annual report to Congress in February of each year       that includes:
        <ul>
          <li>All recommendations made by the  Committee during the preceding calendar year;</li>
          <li>An explanation of how the Secretary  has implemented those recommendations; and</li>
          <li>The reasons for rejecting the  recommendations not implemented.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      </ul>
   
    <ul start="2" type="a">
      <li>c. In  response to the SAFETEA-LU requirement, the Department established the ITS PAC  in 2007.&nbsp; Since its inception, the ITS  PAC has met eleven times.&nbsp; Early ITS PAC  meetings focused on strategic planning activities and program reviews that were  critical to development of the ITS Joint Program Office&rsquo;s (ITS JPO) Five-Year  ITS Strategic Research Plan for FY 2010 &ndash; FY 2014.&nbsp; In 2008 and 2009, the Department solicited  the ITS PAC&rsquo;s specific input on the ITS JPO future mission, goals, and focus  areas.&nbsp; Also, as required by SAFETEA-LU  Section 5305(h)(3)(B), the Department requested that the ITS PAC review proposed  ITS research initiatives and provide the following input:
        <ul>
          <li>Whether current research activities are likely to advance  either ITS state-of-the-practice or state-of-the-art;</li>
          <li>Whether ITS technologies are likely to be deployed by users,  and if not, to determine the barriers to deployment; and</li>
          <li>The appropriate roles for government and the private sector  in investing in the research and technologies being considered.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      </ul>
    
    <ul start="2" type="a">
      <li>d. In  December 2009, the ITS PAC was reconstituted for a new two-year term with 20  members comprising 7 who had served on the previous Committee and 13 new  members.&nbsp; The reconstituted ITS PAC&rsquo;s two  meetings in 2010 focused on leveraging the diverse professional backgrounds and  viewpoints of committee members to gain a better understanding of the relative  importance of critical issues facing the ITS research program.&nbsp; In August 2010, the ITS PAC submitted a  memorandum to the ITS JPO that outlined several issues to form the basis of  subsequent ITS PAC meeting agenda topics and help shape the planning and  execution of the ITS research program.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>2. ITS PAC Activity in 2011</h4>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <li>a. The       ITS PAC met four times in 2011.&nbsp; The       January and March meetings were held at the Oakland California       Metropolitan Transportation Commission and in Detroit, Michigan,       respectively, to provide the ITS PAC more in-depth information on ITS in       transit operations and automobile manufacturer vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)       technology research.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the       January meeting, the ITS PAC established three subcommittees to focus its       evaluation of the ITS research program on three areas that the ITS PAC       considered are the most critical aspects of the program: technology       strategy, standards harmonization, and program evaluation and       strategy.&nbsp; To support the ITS PAC&rsquo;s       efforts, the ITS JPO presented briefings at the January and March meetings       on six ITS research program issues that the ITS PAC had identified for       discussion in its August 2010 memorandum to the ITS JPO.&nbsp; Unfortunately, a V2V demonstration       scheduled for the Detroit meeting was cancelled due to inclement weather.</li>
      </ul>
    
    <ul>
      <li>b. The ITS PAC’s May and June meetings focused on subcommittee deliberations and progress briefings on their assigned ITS research program evaluation topics.  As needed, the subcommittees engaged outside experts and ITS JPO staff in the process of developing their recommendations.  Following wide-ranging discussions and debate, the ITS PAC reached consensus on twenty-six recommendations to help improve the ITS research program in the critical areas of technology strategy, global standards harmonization, and program evaluation and strategy.  The ITS PAC submitted its recommendations in a November 28, 2011 advice memorandum to the Department.  The Department carefully considered the ITS PAC’s advice and responded, describing the Department’s implementation of the Committee’s recommendations.  The ITS PAC’s recommendations and the Department’s response are included in paragraph 3 below.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>3. ITS PAC  Recommendations and U.S. DOT Response</h4>
    
      <p>a. <strong>Technology Strategy</strong>. The ITS PAC concluded that it is       important to consider at least two levels of automotive safety systems it       called soft safety and hard safety. In general, soft safety systems can utilize higher latency       communications for primarily driver information. Hard safety systems involve safety       warnings and vehicle control that must be based on low latency, highly       robust and secure communications, such as from a dedicated short range       communications (DSRC) network.    </p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 1</strong>. Develop  concepts for, promote and facilitate open platforms and standards for software  developers that can be accommodated in the Connected Vehicle infrastructure  architecture, to promote the development and incorporation of &ldquo;soft safety&rdquo;  applications using consumer electronics devices, developer applications for  those devices, and communications interfaces with existing cellular  infrastructure or other consumer networks to enable near term and wide  deployment. Successful deployment of a  Connected Vehicle system depends on widespread adoption by the user community  so that the costs of system expansion can be shared with high volume consumer  applications. This is essential for  promoting consumer buy-in and for motivating the private sector investments  that will drive costs down so the necessary market penetration is achieved.
</p>
<p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to  Recommendation 1</strong>.  The Department concurs with this recommendation and is taking action  toward its implementation. Proper  layering within design of the Connected Vehicle system is a key enabler for  open platforms to support all types of applications. One of the features of the recently completed  system description update is the inclusion of the concept of layered  communications &ndash; the content of the message used to facilitate an application is  separated from the medium used to transport the message. Based on feedback from the ITS PAC and other  stakeholders, the design of the security credential management system that will  initially be used to support the Safety Pilot Model Deployment, a one-year  field test of new vehicle safety systems, makes use of a layered approach so  that other wireless communication media such as cellular could be used for  &ldquo;soft-safety&rdquo; applications as appropriate.  The Department believes that this recommendation serves as a guiding  principle for maximizing the benefits and minimizing the costs associated with  connected vehicle technology integration. </p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 2</strong>. Promote, encourage,  and use open systems that seek to maximize broad-based active developer  communities.</p>
<p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to Recommendation  2</strong>.  The Department concurs with this recommendation and is taking action  toward its implementation. As noted by  the ITS PAC, it is important to engage a broad range of developers to enable a  robust industry and creative development.  At this point in the research program, the Department has taken care to  ensure that all device procurement activities related to the Safety Pilot Model  Deployment have been held as full-and-open competitions. We have attracted a number of companies that  range from small start-ups to old-line automotive and infrastructure  electronics companies. Their devices are  being designed so that they could eventually accommodate third-party  applications. This is one step toward  the broader goal of engaging an active developer community. The Department will continue to be cognizant  of this recommendation from the ITS PAC as research progresses.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 3</strong>. Respond to the  specific need for non-proprietary and/or license-free security, authentication,  and Application Programming Interface (API) standards, which include data among  vehicles and data transmitted between vehicles and infrastructure, as well as  transit schedule-related data.</p>
<p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to  Recommendation 3</strong>.  The Department concurs in principle with this recommendation and is  taking action toward its implementation.  For example, the Department is engaged in policy research products that  outline the viable alternatives for security, authentication, and API standards. As part of this work, per the ITS PAC&rsquo;s  recommendation, the use of non-proprietary approaches will be  investigated. A second activity is the  Safety Pilot Model Deployment, where several security and credential management  schemes are being deployed and evaluated for suitability as a model for  long-term deployment. Again, the  Department understands the ITS PAC&rsquo;s recommendation for non-proprietary  interfaces. The final resolution of this  issue may hinge on the party that becomes the final deploying entity.</p>
<p>For transit data, the goal is for non-proprietary data, and  DOT is currently examining this as part of the Dynamic Mobility Applications  program. Applications will be developed  using non-proprietary data and open sourcing.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 4</strong>. Rely as much as  possible on communications architectures that promote flexibility and  extensibility and can be used across multiple sectors, not just within the  transportation sector.</p>
<p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to  Recommendation 4</strong>.  The Department concurs with this recommendation and is taking action  toward its implementation (see Department&rsquo;s Response to Recommendation 1). This topic was discussed in the ITS PAC&rsquo;s  meetings; therefore, the Department had previous insight into this  recommendation. The thoughts of the ITS  PAC, as well as input from others in the ITS community, prompted the Department  to update the system architecture for connected vehicles. The recently completed system architecture  update emphasized the proper layering of communication to allow the separation  of the message payload from the medium that transports it. This allows a variety of communication media  to be used as fits the needs of the applications, which promotes flexibility  and the broadest possible user base.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 5</strong>. Using the principle  of driver opt-in, consider ways to make vehicle data available to developers  who can then innovate applications serving individuals as well as applications  generating information from the data across wider populations of drivers and vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to  Recommendation 5</strong>.  The Department concurs with this recommendation in part and is taking  action toward its implementation. The  ITS JPO plans to make data from federally-funded research programs available for research purposes in an open data  environment accessible through a Research Data Exchange providing supporting  mobility, weather, and sustainability data environments to application  developers and researchers. We will then  use the lessons learned to support recommendations related to a deployed  connected vehicle environment. However,  in a deployed system, availability of the data is likely to be the prerogative  of the owner of the data. In many  instances, DOT may have limited leverage to compel privately-owned data to be  made available to developers. The  Department agrees that driver opt-in solutions may offer an opportunity to the  broad developer community for greater innovation based on the availability of  new data sources. However, the  Department may have little direct authority in this space, depending upon the  final deployment scenario that is ultimately determined to be viable.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 6</strong>. Emphasize  utilization of common, high-volume commercial sector components wherever  possible to leverage cost curve advantages so that new solutions do not  necessitate high-cost, low-volume components.  Where customization is required, attempt to utilize open, common  hardware standards and customize with software for flexibility and lowered  costs. In addressing aggressive &ldquo;hard  safety&rdquo; goals, the current Connected Vehicle system concept has certain  technological limitations which should be thoroughly analyzed and  evaluated. While active V2V and  vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) programs (collectively,  V2V and V2I concepts are referred to as &ldquo;V2X&rdquo;) need to be pursued in a  timely manner, the Federal Government should continue to reassess its  assumptions and be completely objective about the technology and its  limitations. These limitations are noted  in the following three recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to  Recommendation 6</strong>.  The Department concurs as outlined in the responses below.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 7</strong>. Connected Vehicle  performance will be highly dependent on vehicle positioning performance. Ensure that lane-level positioning is  feasible in most conditions, across all vehicle types, and at acceptable  cost. For V2V communications, relative  lane-level positioning is key, while for V2I, absolute lane-level positioning  is critical.</p>
<p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to Recommendation  7</strong>.  The Department concurs with this recommendation and is taking action  toward its implementation. Further, the  Department concurs with the ITS PAC&rsquo;s assessment that positioning is a critical  element for successful V2V and V2I performance.  Therefore, technical analysis is under way to ensure that this issue is  fully addressed and resolved.  Specifically, the Crash Avoidance Metrics Partnership (CAMP) and the DOT  are jointly conducting extensive research into characterizing the positioning  performance of the various GPS devices and positioning services that make use  of them. Furthermore, in the Safety  Pilot Model Deployment, both V2V and V2I applications will be deployed in the  test environment and extensive data will be collected which can be used to  accurately assess the performance of the devices in terms of absolute and  relative positioning performance. Based  on the results of the data collection, performance standards may be employed to  ensure that V2V and V2I positioning solutions are consistent and accurate  across all manufacturers.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 8</strong>. Near-zero  communications latency and packet loss is essential to V2V safety  performance. Ensure that this is  feasible under extreme communications loads and at acceptable cost.</p>
<p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to  Recommendation 8</strong>.  The Department partially concurs.  First, near-zero packet loss is very difficult to achieve, and current  research has shown that some amount of V2V packet loss is acceptable while  still meeting the minimum V2V performance levels. Furthermore, packet loss alone is not an  adequate metric. Packet loss  requirements must be coupled with requirements on inter-packet gap. We are not prepared, at this point, to  quantify these values and the final specification may vary according to the  various application types. The results  of scalability testing, other performance testing, and the Safety Pilot Model  Deployment will provide a basis for future recommendations on required packet  performance and latency. However, the  intent of the ITS PAC&rsquo;s recommendation is understood and the Department agrees  that reliable performance of the  communications systems is essential for safety-of-life applications. The Department will continue to assess this  issue in future Connected Vehicle research.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 9</strong>. Current DSRC 5.9 GHz  communications have limitations in line-of-sight, range, and signal blockage  and corruption. Ensure that this signal  will be robust in all realistic intersection environments. The potential gap between Federal Government  platform initiatives and private sector deployments - the problem of &ldquo;if we  build it, will they come?&rdquo; - needs to be  monitored and addressed. The success of  a Connected Vehicle Safety System will also require active participation at all  levels of government; it is important to devise ways to speed State, regional  and local adoption of technologies that meet safety goals.</p>
<p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to  Recommendation 9</strong>.  The Department concurs with this recommendation and is taking action  towards better characterization of performance and increased robustness of the  technology. The line-of-sight  limitations of DSRC are currently being tested and results have been  positive. Those tests have demonstrated  strong capability for the signals to take advantage of features in the  environment to cause signals to go around vehicles and around blind  intersections. This capability has been  demonstrated at each of the Safety Pilot Model Deployment driver clinics as  well as at demonstrations in Washington, DC and public demonstrations at the  ITS World Congress in Orlando, Florida.  We continue to conduct performance testing at each of the driver clinic  locations around the country and in a variety of environmental conditions; e.g.,  urban canyons, rural, etc. Roadside equipment  is also being redesigned to include multiple radio sets that provide equally  capable radio lines-of-sight at intersections.  We will also be collecting data as part of the Safety Pilot Model  Deployment to ensure that the technology meets necessary performance  requirements at both intersection and open road environments.</p>
<p>Additionally, another objective of the Safety Pilot Model  Deployment is to begin involving State, regional, and local governments in  limited model deployments to better understand the issues associated with  actual deployment of connected vehicle safety technology. Lessons learned from the Safety Pilot Model  Deployment will be applied both to the DOT research program as well as to the  State and local governments involved with ITS deployment and operation as part  of the continuous ITS technology transfer function. </p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 10</strong>. Use leverage and  incentives to maximize and strategically support a complex nationwide  deployment for an extended period of years.  While V2V capabilities may be mandated for the auto industry, potential  actions affecting other sectors and industries (including the infrastructure  sector) also need to be considered.</p>
<p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to  Recommendation 10</strong>.  The Department concurs with this recommendation and appreciates the  emphasis that the ITS PAC places on this issue.  While V2V capabilities are critical for advancing safety, they alone do  not encompass the entire vision of connected vehicle technology. This vision also includes the capability for  vehicles to interact with traffic signals and &ldquo;back-end&rdquo; systems to support a  multitude of safety, mobility and environmental applications. The ITS policy research being conducted by  the ITS JPO is looking at how the broader network needs for connected vehicles  could be implemented and supported.  Additionally, the Department continues to engage the stakeholder  community throughout all of its research activities related to the connected  vehicle program. Specifically, DOT works  with American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials  (AASHTO) members to understand the perspectives of State and local  agencies. The Department expects to have  more clarity on how to provide for other sectors and industries as the research  illuminates opportunities and tradeoffs.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 11</strong>. Communications with  vehicles and with individuals will require applications at the device level  (including in-vehicle) and the services infrastructure to deliver the required  services and applications. Whatever part  of that infrastructure is defined or implemented by the Federal Government should  be delivered to State and local governments to reduce their required  investment. This could be done via model  deployments that are executed in such a manner that they can truly be  replicated by other regions and organizations.  In order for such model deployments to become permanent, operational  solutions, it is essential to allocate the maintenance and operational expenses  of the system after the termination of the model deployment.</p>
<p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to  Recommendation 11</strong>.  The Department partially concurs.  At this time, the infrastructure requirements to support a connected  vehicle environment are not clear nor is it clear who will be the most logical  party to provide infrastructure should it be needed. Multiple final system implementation models  for connected vehicle infrastructure exist, and various public, private and  hybrid approaches are being explored through the current policy research. Should the best approach involve State and  locally deployed infrastructure, then field testing and model deployments would  certainly be a viable approach to familiarizing State and local agencies with  the technology and facilitating local deployment. However, part of the consideration must  include full deployment and the associated operations and maintenance  costs. The level of effort is not yet  clear and would require serious discussion with any party that provides the  final system. The Department is aware  that the ITS JPO research program funding is not intended, nor adequate for  funding long term operations and maintenance costs of deployed systems.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 12</strong>. Decide on where open  standards are required and ensure that they are put in place so that system  solutions work in all locations and the operation of vehicles and experience of  individuals is the same wherever they travel.</p>
<p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to  Recommendation 12</strong>.  The Department concurs with what we believe to be the underlying intent  of this recommendation. The Department  agrees that an appropriate suite of V2X applications should be made available  to permit seamless nationwide interoperability.  Standards are an essential part of ensuring consistent operation between  vehicles. However, the Department does  not advocate &ldquo;open standards&rdquo; in the sense of the sometimes-used definition  where anyone may add to or alter content of a standard. Rather, the Department advocates open  standards development processes that allow full participation of all interested  stakeholders in the development of standards that are then made available on  equal and reasonable terms to everyone.  For the most part, we support standards development being led by  appropriately qualified standards development organizations (SDO) via their own  processes using open working groups and a rigorous but appropriately tailored  systems engineering process. In our  experience, this has produced the best results for ITS standards, although the  Department supports alternative development processes when advantageous to do  so. Further, when beneficial and  feasible, we of course will continue to seek to harmonize standards  internationally. Currently, it is not  the Department&rsquo;s intent to specify how warning systems will be displayed inside  a vehicle. The Department supports the  vehicle manufacturers&rsquo; opportunity to differentiate their system solutions to  meet all necessary performance requirements &ndash; including those related to driver  distraction.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 13</strong>. Monitor private  sector developments in vehicle communications and safety technologies to ensure  that planned government systems will be compatible.</p>
<p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to  Recommendation 13</strong>.  The Department concurs with this recommendation and is taking action  toward its implementation. In 2008, the  Department, through the ITS JPO, established a technology scanning program to  monitor private sector technology developments related to communications and  other topics with potential implications for the connected vehicle  environment. Recent technology scan  studies have included: Electric Vehicle  and the Smart Grid; Vehicle Based Active Ranging Sensors &ndash; RADAR, LIDAR and  Ultrasonic Sensors; Location Aware Technologies and Vehicle Applications &ndash; High  Resolution Navigation, Computer Vision and Active Ranging Sensors; Stream  Computing and Real-Time Transportation Applications; Global innovations in  computing with a focus on design of secure systems and risk management. Based on the ITS PAC&rsquo;s recommendation and the  great value the Department and its partners and stakeholders have found in  these assessments, the ITS JPO plans to continue the technology scanning effort  to ensure ITS technologies are compatible and interoperable with other  commercial technologies. </p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 14</strong>. Ensure that the  unique needs of full electric and hybrid electric vehicles are included in the  Federal Government developments. Support  and incentivizing of this rapidly emerging segment, which enjoys a large  investment in technology, could assist rapid deployment of Connected Vehicle  technology.</p>
<p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to Recommendation 14</strong>. The  Department concurs with this recommendation and is initiating action toward its  implementation. Based on the ITS PAC&rsquo;s  recommendation, the Department, through the ITS JPO, has allocated funds in the  fiscal year 2012 budget to explore the potential to leverage electric vehicle  research and development into the connected vehicle research. This funding will enable the Department to  better understand the unique needs of full electric and hybrid electric  vehicles. The connected vehicle research  team has had initial discussions with Department of Energy colleagues. The ITS JPO plans to continue this dialogue  as we execute the exploratory research into electric vehicle technology.
</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 15</strong>. Ensure that vehicle  drivers have control over their data and that adequate privacy safeguards are  in place to prevent data breaches and to maximize participants&rsquo; ability to  exercise control over their information.</p>
<p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to  Recommendation 15</strong>.  The Department concurs that privacy and data protection policies are  essential components of any connected vehicle system, and is actively  addressing privacy and security safeguards through the connected vehicle  research. The Federal Fair Information  Practices Principles (FIPPs) established under NIST SP 800-53 Draft, Appendix J  (<a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/800-53-rev4/sp800-53-rev4-ipd.pdf">http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/800-53-rev4/sp800-53-rev4-ipd.pdf</a>)  will provide the framework for analysis of privacy protection in any test or  end-state system involving the Federal Government. However, the Department concurs in part with  the statement that vehicle drivers must have control over their data. Should the Department conclude that some  safety applications be made mandatory, the data needed to support those applications  would be mandatory and not optional. On  the other hand, future opt-in services would allow vehicle drivers to choose  data to be shared as required by the services that they seek.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 16</strong>. Encourage  facilitation of multimodal transport by investigating ways to publish transport  schedule and price data so that it is searchable in real-time.</p>
<p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to  Recommendation 16</strong>. The Department concurs with this recommendation in part and  is taking action toward its implementation in a research environment. The Department plans to make research data available for research  purposes in an open data environment accessible through a Research Data  Exchange providing supporting mobility, weather, and sustainability data  environments to application developers and researchers. Mobility applications and data supporting  multimodal transit, freeway, and arterial transportation are being explored  that can provide transit schedule and pricing data both static and in  real-time.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the transit community,  the Department concurs with the intent of the recommendation. The ITS JPO is working with the Federal  Transit Administration (FTA) and the transit community to address some of these  issues. However, with respect to transit  data, specific data challenges exist.  Since transit agencies own their data, the data they make available may  vary from one agency to another. The  Department has limited authority to require data sharing. Nonetheless, the Department has supported the  concept of open data sharing through standards.  The ITS JPO, in partnership with FTA, has made available standards  (TCIP) and Google has established a common feed standard so that when transit  agencies want to coordinate services they can share information in a common  way. The Department will continue to  encourage and facilitate real-time multimodal data sharing for all high-value  transportation data sets to leverage greater uses and benefit to the traveling  public.
</p>
<h4>b. Global Standards Harmonization</h4>
<p><strong>Recommendation 17</strong>. The ITS JPO should make, and periodically reinforce, a clear  public statement that globally harmonized ITS standards are critical to the  efficient and rapid deployment of ITS technologies. Similar statements from the Administrator of  the Department&rsquo;s Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA),  the Secretary of Transportation, and the  Secretary of Commerce would add important emphasis. The statement should also make clear that the  quality of standards and the degree to which they are harmonized is more  important than arbitrary dates imposed for completing them. While ITS JPO has in the past made such  statements as part of its outreach programs, clear single-purpose statements,  and reinforcement from higher levels within DOT, would be of substantial value.</p>
<p>In order to play a visible, leading role, the  ITS JPO should provide adequate funding to appropriate organizations to involve  more U.S. experts, develop harmonized standards and apply pressure where  appropriate. The appropriate office/department  within the U.S. Government should be identified to assume leadership of this  important issue. It is also critical  that this issue be given adequate senior level political support within DOT,  the Department of Commerce and the White House.  The other regions are invested at the political level and the U.S.  Government should be as well.</p>
<p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to  Recommendation 17</strong>.  The Department concurs that high level  reinforcement for internationally harmonized standards by key U.S. political  leadership is valuable and desirable.  The Department has continued to publicly reinforce our commitment to  internationally harmonized high-quality standards and has cooperated with the  Department of Commerce via the National Institute of Standards and Technology  (NIST) to disseminate our messages.  Recently, the Secretary of Transportation spoke at the ITS World  Congress in Orlando and reiterated his support of the V2V research and met with  the international consortium of automobile manufacturers involved in the  research. Going forward, the ITS JPO  will seek additional opportunities to elevate outreach efforts and advocacy for  harmonization of international standards by senior political leadership including the Secretarial level. Regarding the recommendation that the  appropriate office within the Federal government be identified to assume  leadership of this issue, the Department uses the ITS JPO to coordinate ITS  standards engagement across several agencies within the Department. Specifically, standards continue to be  discussed and coordinated among RITA, National Highway Traffic Safety  Administration (NHTSA), Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Federal Motor  Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), FTA, and the Office of the Secretary  (OST) to ensure high-level visibility and appropriate stakeholder involvement  from all modes. With the ITS JPO serving  in a leadership and coordination role with other DOT modal administrations, the  Department can also connect and cooperate with other governmental and industry stakeholders. The  ITS JPO regularly reports to the Secretary on the progress of international  standards harmonization, as RITA is responsible for the implementation of the  Secretary&rsquo;s Performance Plan item regarding international standards  harmonization.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 18</strong>. The ITS JPO should seek to play a more visible leading role in  encouraging the development of globally harmonized standards by adequately  funding organizations dedicated to and programs designed to result in  harmonized ITS standards, and applying strong political pressure to standards  organizations and other stakeholders where appropriate. Sufficient funding needs to be made available  to effectively deploy U.S. interests in harmonized standards. In the case of federally-funded organizations,  the ITS JPO should fully exercise contractual/grant authority to encourage  harmonization. The ITS JPO should make a  commitment to ensure adequate funding in future years, reinforcing its  commitment to harmonization. The ITS JPO  should ensure sufficient U.S. government staff are involved and encourage  vehicle manufacturer participation in appropriate international standardization  forums.</p>
<p>In order to further support the need for  harmonization, the ITS JPO should fund a detailed analysis that demonstrates  the implications of non-harmonized standards and the obstacles to achieve  harmonized standards. The outcome of  such an analysis would be useful for all members of the standardization  community worldwide. However, it is  noted that if such analysis is not done quickly, its value will be diminished  by the pace of standardization activities in many regions. The ITS PAC recognizes that it will be  challenging to find a means to credibly conduct such a study recognizing the  competitive nature of industry and likely challenges in obtaining sufficient  data of a type that is not normally publicly available.</p>
<p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to  Recommendation 18</strong>.  There are several points in this recommendation with varying levels of  Departmental concurrence. The Department agrees that robust involvement from industry  experts and SDOs is needed to support standards harmonization. Having heard ITS PAC discussion on this topic  over the last year, the Department has strengthened existing programs to  provide appropriate funding for expert, industry, and SDO participation in  activities to support harmonization. In  recent months, these capabilities have been further strengthened by award of a  cooperative agreement task to the Vehicle Infrastructure Integration Consortium  (VIIC) for automobile industry support on harmonization efforts. Further, contracts have been awarded to SAE  International, AASHTO and the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) for  future standards development work. These  contracts specifically require international harmonization support. In all of these activities, the  Department exercises intensive management oversight of the agreements with the  SDOs to ensure the development of standards in a timely manner that will  facilitate the deployment of ITS technologies.  The Department exercises highly effective management without resorting  to any forms of political pressure.</p>
<p>The ITS PAC recommends strong Federal funding  support. To that end, the Department has  allocated additional funding from the ITS budget to support international  standards harmonization efforts. The  Department believes that with the new contracts in place and increased funding  allotments for development of globally harmonized standards, industry support  will further increase. Current budgetary  plans propose to continue this strong support, which appropriately reflects the  high priority of this program. In the  future, we plan to fund additional efforts via SDO contracts and other means to  execute further specific work items in support of the harmonization  program. Additionally, in October 2011,  based on collaborative work between the DOT and the European Commission (EC),  the EC sent letters to the two leading European standards development organizations  encouraging their commitment to participating in international standards  harmonization activities. The Department  is in the process of finalizing a letter to the International Organization for  Standardization (ISO) reiterating our support of harmonization. </p>
<p>The Department concurs that Federal staff  participation is essential. The ITS JPO  has attempted to be as comprehensive as possible within staffing constraints  and increasing international travel restrictions. The Department acknowledges that staff  participation has not been as strong as desirable due to these  constraints. Nonetheless, we believe  Federal staff involvement continues to increase in effectiveness as  relationships are established and strengthened.  In order to provide additional staff support, as recommended by the ITS  PAC, the Department intends to establish a multimodal Federal support team to  ensure appropriate Federal leadership, especially as new work items are  identified.</p>
<p>The Department agrees in principle that a timely  and detailed analysis of the impact on non-harmonized standards would be both  valuable and worthwhile. The Department  also agrees with the ITS PAC&rsquo;s view that it will be challenging to obtain  credible information to support such an analysis. The Department will assess the degree of  difficulty involved in this undertaking and make a final determination  regarding the feasibility of accomplishing this recommendation in the first  quarter of calendar year 2012. </p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 19</strong>. The ITS JPO should fund an analysis of the costs and benefits of harmonized  and non-harmonized ITS standards. At  present, the European Union (EU) and Japanese participants to their respective  regional Harmonization Working Groups (WG) with the U.S. are populated by a mix  of government and industry personnel.  This allows them to address harmonization issues at all levels. In contrast, official U.S. WG members are all  U.S. government employees in order to assure compliance with legal  requirements. Representatives from both  the EU and Japan have stated that they would strongly prefer a mix of  government and industry personnel and that without this mix the discussions are  often inhibited in face-to-face meetings.  Recent ITS JPO action to open WG meetings to additional participants is  an appropriate course of action. In addition,  until recently, meetings of the WG were both infrequent and short. The expansion of participation and increase  in length to 1.5 days of the most recent WG meeting in Vienna in June 2011 is a  welcome change. On this present course,  the Harmonization Plan (HAP) will be completed well after the harmonization  timeline has expired. The pace of Plan  development, and, therefore, the frequency and duration of development meetings  must be accelerated.</p>
<p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to  Recommendation 19</strong>.  The Department concurs that  understanding the underlying costs and benefits of  harmonized and non-harmonized ITS standards would be valuable information. The current costs of V2X technology  implementation are only a forecast with substantial uncertainty. Further, vehicle manufacturers&rsquo; incorporation  of V2X technologies will be accomplished primarily through the purchase of  products from suppliers. In this highly  competitive industry, credible information on these costs is not easily  available. That said, the ITS JPO will  investigate whether such a study may be feasible in the near future.</p>
<p>Regarding the recommendations on frequency and  participation in standards harmonization WG meetings, the Department generally  concurs with the likely long-term benefits of the recommended actions. As a result of the ITS PAC&rsquo;s discussion, the  ITS JPO has already broadened U.S. participation in WG meetings substantially  by including U.S. representatives from SAE, ISO, and the VIIC. The ITS JPO will continue to explore methods  to ensure robust involvement from U.S.-based stakeholders. The ITS JPO also reached agreement with the  EU to increase both the frequency and duration of WG meetings. We intend to maintain this frequency and  level of participation going forward. It  should be noted, however, that the ability to (1) schedule and conduct meetings  and (2) execute HAP work items more quickly are dependent upon our  international partners&rsquo; willingness and ability to act along with the DOT and  U.S. industry partners. The Department  believes that Federal Government staff and non-government involvement is  essential in the strategic establishment of harmonization work groups and  chartering their activities. The  Department plans to continue to enhance stakeholder participation in the  development and execution of both a comprehensive standardization plan for  connected vehicle technologies and in the related harmonization plans that can  now be initiated after completion of the Core System Architecture in late 2011. The Department intends to continue to provide  travel support funding for voluntary industry experts participating in  standards harmonization efforts.  Further, the Department plans to continue engaging with industry experts  via more traditional means, including SDOs, technical support contracts and  cooperative agreements. This commitment  to support U.S.-based experts will be substantial and will enable consistent  and committed participation by the U.S. in harmonization efforts. </p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 20</strong>. The ITS JPO should ensure that the U.S. &ndash; EU Harmonization Task  Force and any future U.S. &ndash; Japan Harmonization Task Force (and any other  existing regional collaborations working on harmonized standards) are properly  supported by both the U.S. Government and industry personnel who are actively  engaged in standards work. Further,  these groups should meet face-to-face more frequently and for longer periods  than had been the case until recently in order to create a workable  Harmonization Plan early enough that it supports the aggressive timeline  proposed for the creation of harmonized standards. Further still, the U.S. should work to  collapse the various regional Harmonization Task Forces into one global  Harmonization Task Force. Presently, a  variety of international and regional standards organizations are developing  ITS standards that will impact the ability to efficiently and effectively  implement V2X. Absent strong leadership  and commitment, these standards will be developed regionally and will result in  inefficiencies and costly duplication of efforts, delaying deployment of  V2X. The U.S. Government should play a  key role in supporting the identification and prioritization of key standards  and support harmonization of those standards.  The U.S. Government should continue to work with Europe and Japan as  well as seek to engage with other major and emerging markets in this  effort. While support for key &ldquo;core&rdquo; V2X  standards is critical to the success of the V2X program, support for the broader  range of ITS standards is also critical considering the breadth of V2X and the  need to send a clear message to standards organizations that they need to work  together to develop a full range of harmonized ITS standards.</p>
<p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to  Recommendation 20</strong>.  The Department concurs with this  recommendation and is acting in accordance with the collective desires of the  countries involved. The U.S. and EU have  included Japanese participation in our cooperative work to the extent desired  by the Japanese, and we have jointly and clearly stated our willingness to  expand cooperation into tri- or multilateral agreements, as well as our  willingness to welcome other interested partners. For example, DOT is currently acting upon an  expression of interest received from the South Korean government. The ITS JPO continues to seek expanded  leadership roles in international harmonization of ITS standards and continues  to support U.S. governmental, standards community and industry participation,  including meeting participation to the extent feasible. As indicated in the response to  recommendation 19, the DOT is looking into mechanisms to enhance industry  expert participation as technical areas are identified for harmonization. In our communications with the EU and Japan  in particular, all parties struggle to balance the demands for individual  research activities and the resources needed for international travel. We share a commitment to multilateral work  and we share the challenges that work at a global scale entails.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 21</strong>. The ITS JPO should work together with industry and others to  develop a list of key V2X standards that should be prioritized for  harmonization. Included in the V2X  standards list should be a harmonized method to qualify any V2X system's  performance and interoperability. Some  work in this area has been done regionally, but the regional data has not been  aggregated and synchronized to create a global list. This final prioritized list should then be  shared with governments in Europe and Japan and a consolidated multilateral  prioritized list negotiated. The  progress of these standards can then be tracked through the various standards  organizations and pressure applied to ensure that they are being developed in a  harmonized fashion. Since V2X will  encompass a broad range of standards, the ITS JPO should work together with  industry and others to promote expanded standardization of ITS standards so  that a clear message is sent to standards organizations about the critical  importance of harmonization. Consideration  should be taken for patents that are embedded in the developed standards (for  example, the IEEE 1609.2 standard and Certicom) and the associated licensing  waivers and agreements.</p>
<p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to Recommendation 21</strong>. The Department concurs with this recommendation and is  acting accordingly. The Department  developed an initial list of candidate standards for harmonization and provided  that list to the EU representatives through the WG. The Department is awaiting EU input on this  list. Further, now that the U.S. V2X  Core System Architecture has been completed, the ITS JPO will proceed with  developing a reference implementation design of a candidate deployment  architecture in order to derive a comprehensive list of candidate interfaces  for standardization; this interface list will then be analyzed for  harmonization potential with respect to EU and other V2X architectures. The ITS JPO continues to cooperate with  stakeholders to promote expanded harmonization of ITS standards.  The Department is in the process of developing a letter to ISO to  encourage the development of harmonized standards. Our recent contracts with SAE, AASHTO, and  ITE include language requiring the SDOs to work on standards harmonization where  applicable. Additionally, the Department  has initiated a Legal Policy sub-team to research and assess the issue of  embedded patents associated with V2X technologies and recommend appropriate  steps regarding any
needed licensing actions. </p>
<h4>c. Program Evaluation and  Strategy</h4>
<p><strong>Recommendation 22</strong>. In  addition to making progress toward national deployment objectives, the ITS JPO  should provide an effective program and incentives to support system  development, investment, and deployment by others such as State and local  entities and private sector technology developers. The ITS JPO should identify and quantify its  investment in major program elements that are designed to support deployment  such as prototype development, technical feasibility, demonstration pilots,  evaluations, standards development, facilitation forums, etc. The ITS JPO should measure how the ITS  investment in each of the major program elements has resulted in deployment by  others; e.g., deployment tracking.</p>
<p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to  Recommendation 22</strong>.  The Department partially concurs with this recommendation. Over the last two decades, ITS activities  within the Department have grown and matured so that today the Department&rsquo;s ITS  involvement encompasses several modal administrations, as well as the research  program managed by the ITS JPO. The  complete picture of ITS within DOT must be viewed from a Departmental level, of  which the ITS JPO is only one part. For  example, FMCSA manages the Commercial Vehicle Information Systems and Networks  (CVISN) program, FHWA has an active ITS program in support of transportation  planning and operations, FTA supports ITS activities specific to transit  properties, and NHTSA supports the Next Generation 911 office. The efforts of these modal administrations are  more specifically focused on deployment within their individual mission  areas. The ITS JPO works closely with  these modal administrations and, in some cases, provides additional research  funding support to supplement funding they have access to within their modal  budgets. When combined, these  Department-wide activities form a complete picture of ITS, from research and  testing through the final deployment stages.</p>
<p>More specifically to the ITS JPO, per current legislation,  the purpose of the ITS JPO program is to &ldquo;research, develop and operationally  test&rdquo; ITS, as well as to provide &ldquo;technical assistance&rdquo; in application of  ITS. Consequently, the ITS JPO program  focuses on research and makes use of model deployments, field operational  tests, and technical demonstrations.  There are many examples of the use of field deployments over the history  of the program, the most recent of which include field tests of the Integrated  Corridor Management (ICM) program, Mobility Services for all Americans (MSAA),  CVISN, the Congestion Initiative, and the Rural Safety Initiative. Field tests and technical demonstrations such  as these and others provide an opportunity for evaluation under real-world  conditions and give opportunity for stakeholder (both public sector and private  sector) involvement. The most recent  example is the Safety Pilot Model Deployment, which will be a real-world test  of connected vehicle V2V and V2I technology.</p>
<p>With that background, the Department is not clear what the  ITS PAC intends by the recommendation to provide &ldquo;incentives.&rdquo; For example, the Department does not have  authority to change match requirements for ITS deployment projects; however,  ITS projects are eligible for Federal-aid funds. Secondly, the choice of which projects to  fund is the prerogative of State and local planning agencies. Further, we believe that the ITS PAC did not intend that ITS research dollars be  used to fund ITS deployment, as the amount of ITS research funds is  insufficient to make an impact on nationwide ITS deployment. On the other hand, ITS research funds are  actively used to seed technology development and new industries that support technology  applications in transportation. </p>
<p>Finally, the Department is pleased to note the ever-growing  pace of ITS deployment. The most recent  ITS deployment tracking survey, completed in 2010, indicates multimodal growth  in ITS deployment (survey results at http://www.itsdeployment.its.dot.gov). Estimates from our most recent ITS deployment  tracking indicates that the largest 75 metropolitan areas cumulatively invest  $500 million per year on ITS. The  current level of ITS investment among the largest metropolitan areas is  estimated to be $18 billion. ITS  deployment, however, is not equal across all segments of the transportation  industry. Toll agencies have reached  near saturation in ITS toll technology.  Large transit properties have made strong use of traveler information  for transit schedules. Nonetheless, the  Department is in full agreement that ITS deployment benefits from continued  emphasis to ensure growth and expansion.  The Department, through modal administrations and the ITS JPO, will  continue to promote and facilitate deployment in coordination with State and  local agencies responsible for deployment planning, operations, and  maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 23</strong>. The ITS JPO should  facilitate and accelerate institutional transformation among the DOT modal  administrations and through Federal interactions with State/local governments  and the private sector. The ITS JPO  should communicate transferable lessons across geographic areas where it is of  fundamental value (or necessary) to achieve progress towards deploying  transportation technologies.</p>
<p>Department&rsquo;s Response to  Recommendation 23.  The Department concurs in part with this recommendation. The ITS JPO uses a number of tools to  communicate transferable lessons to potential ITS adopters across geographic  areas. The ITS Knowledge Resource  databases, available online, free to the public, provide a unique collection of  reports, studies, technical documents, and instructional guides for planning,  procuring, and deploying ITS. Four  databases are available that are focused on ITS costs, benefits, lessons  learned, and deployment statistics.  Additionally, specific technology transfer components are embedded  within the major research initiatives, such as ICM, MSAA and the Congestion  Initiative. The ITS Professional  Capacity Building (PCB) Program contributes to the transfer of ITS technology  through in-person and online training courses, web seminars, peer exchanges,  and workshops primarily directed at the State and local transportation  agencies. The variety of content and  formats allow ITS professionals to meet their learning needs in the most  customized and accessible way. The ITS  JPO continues to work closely with the DOT modal administrations and actively  seek areas to effectively partner in knowledge and technology transfer efforts.  For example, the ITS PCB Program has  partnered with FHWA and FTA to conduct training courses as well as the delivery  of technical webinars and other knowledge transfer activities. However, as mentioned above, the ITS JPO is  only one part of the ITS presence within the DOT. The Department views ITS as an inherently  multimodal activity, and as such, technology transfer must be, and is, included  in the mission areas of all modal administrations actively involved with ITS,  in addition to the ITS JPO. The Department  acknowledges the ITS PAC&rsquo;s recommendations pertaining to institutional  transformation of DOT modal administrations.  The Department believes that much institutional transformation has  occurred. This is exemplified by  expanded FHWA involvement in transportation operations and active NHTSA  management of critical V2V program elements, as well as the relocation of the  ITS JPO into RITA. All of these  progressive changes speak to the cooperative efforts between the ITS JPO and  modal leadership that reflect the strong commitment across DOT to foster  deployment of ITS technologies. However,  consistent with the ITS PAC&rsquo;s recommendation, the Department will continue to  explore new ways to leverage lessons learned across geographic regions and  across modal administrations to advance ITS adoption.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 24</strong>. The ITS JPO should  develop and execute strategies to support investments in modal technologies  that are adaptable to other modes. The  ITS JPO should evaluate these strategies to determine the degree to which  technology investments that are made primarily for a single transportation mode  will be beneficial to other modes.</p>
<p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to  Recommendation 24</strong>.  The Department concurs with this recommendation and has made a  significant effort to ensure that the ITS research program reflects a  multimodal perspective. The ITS Program  is structured to be multimodal, and involves nearly all of the surface  transportation administrations within the Department. By bringing the modes together to coordinate  research, the Department, through the ITS JPO, fosters the sharing of knowledge  about technologies that can be applied across modes in two ways:</p>
<p>One way is through applying technology developed for a  specific mode; e.g., automated vehicle location on transit vehicles, to  deployment in other modes.</p>
<p>A second approach is to support activities that promote  multimodal solutions. Examples include  ICM and Adaptive Transportation Demand Management (ADTM) that foster the use of  modal technologies to solve multimodal issues for the entire transportation  system. Through ICM, the Department  provides guidance to assist agencies in managing the transportation network as  a system. Agencies learn how to manage  their regional and cross-jurisdictional corridors as an integrated asset in  order to improve travel time reliability and predictability, help manage  congestion and empower travelers through better information and more choices. ADTM builds on this work using technologies  and innovative operational approaches for improving traffic flows and  transportation efficiency within the existing infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 25</strong>. The ITS JPO should  work toward an ITS program that contributes to a sustainable transportation  system that supports economic development, environmental protection, and social  equity. The ITS JPO should propose the  key metrics for each of these sustainability objectives and the data collection  required as technology deployment occurs.  Measures should include the degree to which an integrated strategy of  ITS investments at the regional/metropolitan planning organization level, as  determined by the federally-required metropolitan planning process, results in  achievement of a more sustainable transportation system.</p>
<p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to  Recommendation 25</strong>.  The Department concurs and is in the very early stages of considering  sustainability metrics for ITS research.  In order to reduce the learning curve, the Department is seeking to  learn from others by developing these metrics in coordination with the EC and  Japan as part of the formal agreement to share research results. Once developed, it is our intent for these  metrics to be included in future ITS deployment tracking surveys. We note the ITS PAC&rsquo;s recommendation that  these measures be incorporated into the metropolitan planning process. FHWA&rsquo;s Offices of Operations and Planning lead  the Department&rsquo;s work on incorporating ITS into transportation planning processes. Representatives from these offices are part  of current discussions on this subject.  Further discussions are planned with these Offices to ensure the ITS  PAC&rsquo;s recommendations are fully considered in the Department&rsquo;s work going  forward. </p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 26</strong>. The ITS JPO should  recommend program-level performance metrics, including metrics for the  recommendations of the other two subcommittees, for review by the ITS PAC and  implement them as an integral part of an ongoing independent evaluation to  measure specific outcomes against expectations.</p>
<p><strong>Department&rsquo;s Response to  Recommendation 26</strong>.  The Department concurs with the intent  of this recommendation. The ITS JPO is currently working with the Volpe National  Transportation Systems Center and the v<a name="_GoBack" id="_GoBack"></a>arious programs to  investigate project, portfolio-level, and program metrics intended to evaluate  the overall performance of the ITS Program.  Individual project milestones are important measures of success for  internal investment decision-making as well as external communication to  stakeholders. In addition, the ITS  Program is developing processes to enable Program-level evaluation based on a  portfolio-level approach. The recommendations  made by the ITS PAC are helpful and provide information for consideration in  this effort. Reviews of other Federal  Government portfolio research programs provided some views on how to approach  this effort, but there is no one specific approach that directly applies to  ITS. However, best practices obtained  from across the Federal Government; specific information from the benefits,  costs, and lessons learned databases; and information from the ITS PAC will be  used to develop an approach tailored to the unique aspects of the ITS JPO.</p>
