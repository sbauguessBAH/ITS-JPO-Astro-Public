Transit managers look at transit signal priority (TSP) as a potential tool to improve schedule adherence and service reliability, and increase transit vehicle efficiency with minimal negative impacts to the full traffic network operations. While TSP is deployed in the US, the advent of connected vehicle (CV) technology provides additional advantages for the deployment of TSP that can be embraced by regions deploying CV technology.

Module 25 is a continuation of a series of modules on ITS standards for arterial management and transit signal priority. The previous module in the series, Module 21: Application of Arterial Management and Transit Signal Priority Standards, provided details on the standards that support signal control priority and how to use those standards to develop, specify, and test a TSP implementation, including implementation in a connected vehicle environment.

The focus of this module is the implementation of transit signal priority in a connected vehicle environment. This module introduces the relevant standards to support transit signal priority in a connected vehicle environment and presents how the transit agency can prepare for a CV implementation. This module also provides details and lessons learned from current TSP in a CV environment deployment.
