On-board Transit Management for buses covers technologies and systems that are located within transit vehicles that facilitate and automate operations, management, maintenance, safety, and security functions of public transit systems. While there are currently few standards that govern receiving and transmitting the data and information generated by these systems, the use of the existing relevant Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) standards facilitate the systems' operations and maintenance.

An on-board system can include a vehicle area network (VAN), mobile data terminal (MDT), vehicle logic unit (VLU), equipment for supervisor/support vehicles, an Automated Vehicle Announcement (AVA) System (covered in Modules 6 and 7), an Automatic Passenger Counter (APC) System (covered in Modules 2 and 5), an Event Data Recorder System (EDRS), and Vehicle Component Monitoring (VCM) (covered in Modules 2 and 5), and On-board Video Surveillance System (covered in Modules 2 and 5).

The purpose of Module 19 is to provide details of on-board hardware and software standards. The information provided in this module will help participants further understand those standards that support On-board Transit Management functions for buses, specifically SAE J1587, J1708, and J1939 profiles, and how to procure systems using these standards. Topics covered in this module include single point logon/logoff, data upload/download from an on-board device, and the use of an interface control document (ICD).
