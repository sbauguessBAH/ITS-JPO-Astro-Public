Electronic Fare Payment (EFP) is the automated calculation, validation, collection, recording, and reporting of passenger fare payments using some form of electronic media for trips on a public transportation system.

Included in the options available for EFP systems is the acceptance of contactless bankcards (credit, debit and prepaid debit cards that are issued by financial institutions) and mobile wallets linked to bankcards for the payment of fares directly at transit points of entry. Such acceptance is generally referred to as "Open Payments" within the mass transit industry.

Implementation of Open Payment acceptance as part of an electronic fare payment (EFP) system will create a number of technical and operational impacts for the agency and its system integrator although these may, depending on the implementation approach applied, be offset by certain benefits that are unique to this form of fare payment.

The purpose of Module 12 is to provide an in-depth review of the key stakeholders within the bankcard industry as well as the standards and specifications, technologies, regulations and techniques associated with the procurement and implementation of Open Payments acceptance capability. Contents of the module will identify and explore the challenges, risks, and benefits associated with Open Payments acceptance in order to enable participants to understand this approach and to evaluate its use as part of an EFP solution.
