This module (Transit Management Standards, Part 1 of 2) is the first of the two course modules on transit management using standards. This module provides the background for understanding transit management functions and the standards that facilitate the implementation of systems and technologies that support those transit management functions by:

1. Briefly explaining the transit management functions and systems within the context of National ITS Architecture;
2. Describing the basic taxonomy that will help define where standards should be considered within the functions;
3. Discussing the functions of transit management systems to conceptualize technology implementation at an agency so that participants understand where the standards can be used; and
4. Introducing systems engineering process (SE) and its use in planning, procuring and deploying transit management systems.
