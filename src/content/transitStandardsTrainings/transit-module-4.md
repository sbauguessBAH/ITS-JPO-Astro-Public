This course is the second of a two-module set on TCIP. It will introduce transit agency staff and vendors to the suite of tools needed to access and efficiently use the TCIP standard to create data exchange interfaces among various transit business systems. The tools are available as free downloads from the American Public Transportation Association (APTA). Information in this module will allow transit agency staff and vendors to apply a standards-based framework for procurement and deployment of ITS systems to better manage transit agency operations and assets, and to better serve customers.
