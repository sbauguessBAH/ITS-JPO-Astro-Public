The Accessible Transportation Technologies Research Initiative (ATTRI) is a joint U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) initiative, co-led by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and Federal Transit Administration (FTA), with support from the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Joint Program Office (JPO) and other Federal partners. ATTRI is conducting research into the use of ITS and other advanced technologies to improve the mobility of travelers with disabilities. ATTRI will enhance the capability of travelers to reliably and safely execute independent travel. Transit agencies engaged or considering use of technologies to serve mobility needs of people with disabilities, veterans with disabilities, and older adults will benefit from the information provided by this module.

ATTRI leverages recent advances in vehicle, infrastructure, and pedestrian-based technologies, as well as accessible data, mobile computing, robotics, artificial intelligence, object detection, and navigation. The technology is enabled by wireless communications that connect travelers and their mobile devices, vehicles, and infrastructure. The technologies used by ATTRI provide almost ubiquitous access to a wealth of Realtime situational data sources, including data specific to transportation, municipalities, point of interest, crowd-sourced information, and accessibility data. Five (5) technology areas have emerged as ATTRI focus areas: wayfinding and navigation, assistive technologies, automation and robotics, data integration, and enhanced human service transportation. This module will provide current status of these technologies.

The purpose of Module 17 is to provide the background and scope of the ATTRI and specific activities. This module will discuss the five technology focus areas of the initiative and the four applications selected for prototype development. Discussion will include the ITS standards relevant to the application areas.
