There is a wide variety of on-board transit technologies and they're integrated using several types of communications technologies. These on-board technologies facilitate and automate operations, management, maintenance, traveler information, safety, and security functions of public transit systems. With the advent of newer communication technologies, on-board technologies can be integrated via an on-board transit architecture that is comprised of on-board devices, communications pathways (on and to/from the vehicle), functionality, and interfaces to the vehicle. On-board devices include a mobile data terminal (MDT), vehicle logic unit (VLU) (sometimes combined with an MDT), equipment to support supervisory and support functions (e.g., ruggedized laptop), Automated Vehicle Announcement (AVA) System (covered in Modules 6 and 7), Automatic Passenger Counter (APC) System (covered in Modules 2 and 5), an Event Data Recorder System (EDRS) and Vehicle Component Monitoring (VCM) (covered in Modules 2 and 5), and On-board Video Surveillance System (covered in Modules 2 and 5). Module 19 provides details of how to use on-board hardware and software standards and provides case studies and examples that demonstrate how to procure systems that use these standards.

This module provides details of how to leverage current communication technologies to integrate on-board devices, and provides case studies and examples that demonstrate the use of these technologies. The information in this module will help participants further understand those communication technologies that support the integration of on-board transit devices for buses, specifically Internet of Things (IoT) Gateways, Mobile Gateway Router (MGR), future second generation on-board architectures and the evolution of on-board IoT edge logic. Topics that will be covered in this module include current and future on-board architectures, IoT gateways, moving on-board functionality to the cloud, and transit agency considerations.
