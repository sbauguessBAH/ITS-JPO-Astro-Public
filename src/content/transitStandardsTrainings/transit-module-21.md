Transit managers look at transit signal priority (TSP) as a potential tool to improve schedule adherence and service reliability, and increase transit vehicle efficiency with minimal negative impacts to the full traffic network operations. Signal Control Priority (SCP) is an operational strategy that provides preferential treatment (priority) to facilitate the movement of fleet vehicles such as transit, emergency service, and commercial fleets through signalized intersections.

Module 20 builds on previously developed Arterial Management and Transit Signal Priority Transit Standards training modules (Module 8: Arterial Management and Transit Signal Priority: Understanding User Needs for Signal Control Priority (SCP) Based on NTCIP 1211 Standard and Module 9: Arterial Management and Transit Signal Priority: Specifying Requirements for Signal Control Priority (SCP) Based on NTCIP 1211 Standard).

Module 20 provides additional details on the standards that support signal control priority and how to use those standards to develop, specify, and test a TSP implementation. In addition, this module will present several case studies on how different agencies implemented their TSP projects. These case studies discuss some of the constraints that those implementations faced, the architecture that was selected to implement TSP, how the appropriate standards were used in those implementations, and how testing was performed. This module will provide a use case on how transit signal priority was implemented in a connected vehicle environment.
