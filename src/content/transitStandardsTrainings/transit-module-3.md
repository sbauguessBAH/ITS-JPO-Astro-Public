This course (TCIP 1) is the first of a two-module set on TCIP. This course will provide an introduction and overview of TCIP, concentrating on the contents of Volume 1 of the standard. The module describes the components of the standard, including the development of a transit agency architecture as a framework for procuring and implementing ITS systems, introduces the concepts of operations that illustrate how various business systems can be configured to exchange information, and describes the structural building blocks, data elements, data frames, messages, and dialogs that are used to standardize the exchange of information.

This module will provide the basic knowledge allowing transit agency staff and vendors to begin the process of applying a standards-based framework for procurement and deployment of ITS systems to better manage transit agency operations and assets, and to better serve customers.
