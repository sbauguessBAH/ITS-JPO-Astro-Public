This module (Arterial Management and Transit Signal Priority: Specifying Requirements for Signal Control Priority (SCP) Based on the NTCIP 1211 Standard) is the second of a two-modules set in arterial management. The first module provides the background for understanding the standards that facilitate arterial management by describing how an SCP system works, introducing the capabilities offered by an SCP system, and identifying the role of standards in an SCP system. This module builds on the content of Module 8 and provides participants with detailed information on how to identify and use applicable ITS standards to procure and operate a signal control priority system following a Systems Engineering process.
