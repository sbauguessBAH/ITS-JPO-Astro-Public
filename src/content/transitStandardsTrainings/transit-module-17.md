Transit agencies are implementing more ITS and information technology (IT) systems to improve the delivery of transit services and enable more effective control and management of the overall transit network. Often, the increase in IT/ITS projects also creates design, operations, and maintenance complexities for systems, data, and other technology components within a transit agency. For example, many ITS systems must communicate or share data with other systems. Further, with more ITS systems within an agency, interdependencies between hardware devices increase. As a result, it can become difficult to efficiently plan and troubleshoot business processes and systems.

The use of Enterprise Architecture (EA) principles and tools provide managers and staff better visibility into the components of their organization and the overall relationships among their enterprise's people, processes, applications, data, and technology components.

The purpose of Module 16 is to provide an introduction to Enterprise Architecture (EA) for transit managers and staff. It describes the four layers commonly seen in transit enterprise architectures:
1. Business Architecture
2. Data or Information Architecture
3. Applications Architecture
4. Technology Architecture

In an EA, the identification of connections between components in the different architecture layers and the architecture drivers, such as goals and standards, along with their role, provide significant value to a transit agency. This module highlights a wide range of EA uses and benefits to a transit organization and its ITS efforts. To support the development of a transit agency EA, this module will briefly discuss some possible tools, resources, needed staff roles, and potential challenges. It will identify known EA efforts in transit. The module will highlight some of the possible beneficial relationships between an agency's EA and its Regional ITS Architecture, standards, systems engineering efforts, and IT/ITS project architectures.
