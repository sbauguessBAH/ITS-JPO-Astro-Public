This introductory module provides an overview of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) transit standards for practicing transit professionals and decision-makers who are engaged in the deployment of ITS for transit. This course will highlight the program and organizational benefits, costs of the adaptation, and use of ITS Standards to support the deployment of interoperable systems. This module will also summarize and provide the context for the more detailed subsequent modules of transit standards training, and provide the audience with a useful roadmap of other standards modules they might want to view. As such, this module serves as a useful prerequisite for Modules 2 through 11, and is also recommended for senior transit management due to its review of benefits and costs, which are key issues related to the implementation of ITS transit standards.
