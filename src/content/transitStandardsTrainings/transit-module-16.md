After major natural and man-made disasters, the ISO Technical Committee on ITS (TC 204) initiated a three-part standard called ISO 19083 Emergency Evacuation and Disaster Response and Recovery (EEDRR) to define the framework, data flows, and use cases that support the application of a decision support system for evacuations and disaster response and recovery as it applies to public transport organizations. The goal of the Emergency Evacuation Standard of Communication/Incident Management ISO 19083 standard is to save lives and aid recovery by using ITS technologies to coordinate a comprehensive transportation response to disaster. This includes evacuating people out of harm's way and providing transportation support for all response to and recovery efforts from major disasters such as hurricanes, tsunamis, or catastrophic accidents.

The ISO 19083 standard recommends public transport serve as the primary mobility agent for all transportation-related coordinated actions before, during, and after a disaster. This represents a paradigm shift from past response and recovery efforts, which typically see transportation-related activities coordinated by emergency managers who rely on traffic managers and public transport operators to provide the services. The reasoning for this shift of responsibility is that public transport has the most experience and the resources to move large numbers of people efficiently and in a timely manner which is paramount before, during, and after a disaster.

The purpose of Module 15 is to introduce the Emerging Evacuation Standard of Communication/Incident Management ISO 19083 standard-based framework, used to identify participating organization roles and responsibilities, establish criteria for use of public transport, and support the development of an Emergency Evacuation and Disaster Response and Recovery (EEDRR) Decision Support System (DSS). The DSS will be used to assist, coordinate, and direct all transportation services including those used by emergency management, traffic management, and public transport. This module also identifies guidelines to improve coordination among regional authorities when public transport disaster support is required.
