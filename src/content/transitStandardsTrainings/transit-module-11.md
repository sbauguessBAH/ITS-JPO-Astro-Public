The Connected Vehicle (CV) environment currently being researched and pilot deployment tested by USDOT has the potential to transform surface transportation systems via wireless connectivity so that vehicular crashes are significantly reduced, travelers have access to specific traveler information, and operators of the surface transportation systems have access to more accurate system performance data, thereby optimizing surface transportation systems. For transit operators, this environment provides an opportunity to implement emerging safety and mobility applications to improve public transit service by increasing highway safety, transit productivity, mobility efficiency, and accessibility while providing its users with better transit services and travel information.

This module will provide participants with an introduction to the Transit CV Environment; an understanding of its potential benefits to transit operators and users; and explain how to start preparing for the transit applications within the connected vehicle environment. The module will outline some of the data that may be exchanged between connected devices and the CV and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) standards that support those exchanges, and illustrate how that information may be used to create a safe, stable, interoperable, and reliable transit system.
