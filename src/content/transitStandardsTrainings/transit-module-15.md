The purpose of this second module on GTFS (Part 2 of 2) is to focus specifically on GTFS-realtime. As an extension of GTFS, the General Transit Feed Specification Real Time (GTFS-realtime) is a data feed specification that allows public transportation agencies to provide realtime updates about their fleet. The GTFS specification is an open data format for public transportation schedules and associated geographic information. GTFS-realtime was designed around ease of implementation, good interoperability, and a focus on passenger information. This module aims to assist transit agencies in applying the open and accessible GTFS-realtime specification.

GTFS-realtime requires information from various sources to generate quality real time information, including GTFS. Module 15 provides an overview of the GTFS-realtime specification, a discussion of its scope, how to implement it, and uses of the specifications, including how an agency would implement GTFS-realtime. Additionally, this module will describe downstream uses of GTFS-realtime feeds.
