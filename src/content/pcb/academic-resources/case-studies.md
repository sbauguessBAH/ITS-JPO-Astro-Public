The ITS PCB Program offers higher education instructors learning resources for the classroom. Academic ITS Case Studies are scenario-based learning tools that can be used to expose students to real-world decisions that come with planning, deploying, and operating ITS technologies.

ITS Case Studies are organized by instructor files (PowerPoints and PDFs of Word documents) and student files. Both sets of files include a study guide, a presentation on the technology, the actual case study, and the case study debrief.

- Instructors must register to gain access to the instructor files
- Student files are available for anyone to view
