ITS PCB Program and the National Operations Center of Excellence (NOCoE) developed a student competition, the Transportation Technology Tournament (TTT) to assist ITS students in working directly with public agencies to solve real-world transportation problems utilizing ITS and TSMO solutions. The competition allows student teams to leverage their experience, education, and ITS PCB materials to develop a solution or suite of solutions to directly address the transportation problem.

A detailed description of the TTT, its deadlines, and a list of the student teams participating is available atÂ [https://transportationops.org/transportation-technology-tournament](https://transportationops.org/transportation-technology-tournament).
