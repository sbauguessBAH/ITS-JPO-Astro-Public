This module is a continuation of Module 11 - Transit and the Connected Vehicle Environment/Emerging Technologies, Applications, and Future Platforms. Module 11 described the connected vehicle environment using Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC), relevant standards, and transit applications including those in the FTA Integrated Dynamic Transit Operations (IDTO) program.

The purpose of this module is to expand discussion on the connected vehicle environment for transit to accommodate "advancing automation" in the U.S. DOT 2015-2019 ITS Strategic Plan and in the recent initiative announced by the U.S. DOT.

Module 18 will provide transit agencies and other interested participants with an overview of developments in vehicle automation that complement vehicle connectivity for both bus and rail transit. This module will define relationships between connectivity and autonomy for transit vehicle operation. It will present examples of the state-of-the art transit vehicle automation applications including autonomous lane keeping and collision avoidance warning systems. This module also will describe how connectivity and automation are being deployed in rail transit, primarily in terms of train control systems for safety and capacity.
