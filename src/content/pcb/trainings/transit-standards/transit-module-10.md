Electronic Fare Payment is the automated calculation, validation, collection, recording, and reporting of passenger fare payments using some form of electronic media for rides on a mass transit system. The options available for electronic fare payment (EFP) systems have increased significantly over the last 20 years. However, for the majority of mass transit system operators in the U.S., paying for a ride on public transit still involves the use of non-electronic fare media including coins, flash passes, metal tokens, and paper transfers and tickets. These payment media offer few opportunities for automation and, as a result, provide minimal information to the agency on payments and ridership; require passengers to carry and use loose change in order to pay the exact fare; utilize manual, visual validation by vehicle operators, inspectors, and conductors; and are often inconvenient for passengers to acquire. Agencies universally embrace the need to adopt electronic fare payment systems that provide for more automated means of distribution and validation of fare media. This substantially improves the quantity and quality of payment and ridership data that is collected, and offers significant improvements in the convenience and ease of use for the passenger.

All transit agencies are motivated to periodically evaluate their existing fare collection methodology, equipment, and system in order to determine if conversion to some form of electronic fare payment (or an enhancement to, or replacement of an existing automated fare payment system) is required. Whether to identify the requirements for a replacement fare collection system to address the steadily increasing demands for better and more timely delivery of accurate ridership and fare payment data, or to fulfill the ongoing obligation to improve passenger convenience and promote use of mass transit, agencies must understand the features and benefits offered by the different forms of electronic fare payment systems. Today, such systems can be implemented to enable acceptance of magnetic stripe cards and tickets, contactless smart cards, and, where appropriate, could include fare payment using a mobile phone application or a bank-issued contactless debit or credit card.
This module provides a comprehensive overview of the standards, technologies, and techniques associated with traditional as well as leading edge electronic fare payment systems and their associated benefits, risks, and issues in order to enable participants to understand and select the solutions that best meet the needs of a specific agency.
