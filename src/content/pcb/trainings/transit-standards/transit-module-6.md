This module (Traveler Information Standards, Part 1 of 2) is the first of two course modules on Traveler Information using standards. This module provides the background for understanding Traveler Information systems and the standards that facilitate the implementation of these systems by:

1. Briefly explaining Traveler Information systems within the context of National ITS Architecture;
2. Describing the basic taxonomy that will help define where standards should be considered within the functions; and
3. Discussing the functions of Traveler Information systems to conceptualize technology implementation at an agency so that participants understand where the standards can be used.
