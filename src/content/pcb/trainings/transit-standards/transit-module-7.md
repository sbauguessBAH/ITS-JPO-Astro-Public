Using the background knowledge provided in Module 6 (Traveler Information, Part 1 of 2), this module begins the process of applying the standards that facilitate the implementation of Traveler Information technologies. It will provide participants with the knowledge needed to identify and select the most appropriate standard for their particular situation, to use software and hardware standards introduced in the previous module, and to incorporate standards into procurements. The structure and use of data exchange standards for Traveler Information systems are described along with how to apply standards to the development of procurement specifications. Case studies are incorporated to enhance participants' understanding of how to use the standards.
