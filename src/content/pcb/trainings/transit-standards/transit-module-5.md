This module (Transit Management Standards, Part 2 of 2) is the second of the two course modules on Transit Management Standards. It introduces hardware and software standards in addition to TCIP, and how to use them. The information in this module will help participants identify which standards are most applicable to a particular situation so that an agency can reduce the life cycle cost of technologies that support Transit Management functions and facilitate the integration with legacy or future technology systems. The structure and use of data exchange standards for Transit Management systems are described along with how to apply standards to the development of procurement specifications. Case studies are incorporated to enhance participants' understanding of how to use the standards.
