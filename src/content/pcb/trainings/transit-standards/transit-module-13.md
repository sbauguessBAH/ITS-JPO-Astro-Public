With ICM, agencies work together to optimize travel within the corridor by providing travelers with actionable information and implementing innovative operational practices and strategies, enabled by Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) technologies.

To plan and implement these strategies, technology often plays a strong role. These technologies include parking management systems, Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL), and Automatic Passenger Counter (APC) technologies on transit, traffic-sensing technology on roads, and methods of information dissemination, both for travelers and transportation managers. It is anticipated that having access to and using this information will support better situational awareness and response than before ICM.

Transit agencies can play an important role in the process of improving mobility and reduce congestion on a busy corridor through the collection and use of real-time information on the location and capacity of transit vehicles. Real-time information enhances the ability of an agency to provide additional capacity to improve person throughput. Finally, ITS standards have the ability to facilitate integration of ICM technologies and systems. Standards for facilities, centers, and operators within a corridor support corridor management strategy, interoperability of systems, control and sharing of technologies and data, and interchangeability of technologies. Several specific standards are considered as a part of ICM strategies, and these will be introduced in this module.

Module 13 provides an introduction to ICM that includes highlighting pertinent transit and other standards deployed through the use of ICM case studies. There are four basic concepts within ICM that will be briefly described in this module: (1) Corridor modes of operation; (2) Strategic areas for ICM; (3) Conceptual levels within the corridor; and (4) ICM environment.
