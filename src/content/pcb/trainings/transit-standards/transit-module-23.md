Social media platforms have empowered individuals to share their thoughts about all aspects of daily lifeâ€”from restaurants to movies to political candidates. Increasingly, they are commenting about public transportation services as well. Social channels like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram have made it easier for transit customers to report on service, maintenance, and safety-related issues, and to do so in real time.

These comments can be a valuable source of business intelligence for transit providers, providing feedback that can inform decisions on operations, planning, and investment. But despite the widespread use of social media, extracting meaningful information from Facebook posts or Twitter tweets requires specialized analysis techniques.

Big data is the technical approach to managing datasets that are too large or complex for traditional data processing tools. Data mining is a technique used in a big data environment for extracting meaningful or actionable information from large datasets, including those comprising social media posts. Sentiment analysis, sometimes called opinion mining, uses data mining techniques to discern subjective opinions about a topic of interest. Sentiment analysis has been used to examine rider attitudes toward transit service based on a sampling of tweets or other posts.

Business intelligence combines information from multiple sources, including big data, to enable organizations to make data-driven decisions. For transit providers, business intelligence can inform and support service planning, operations, and investment decisions.

This module provides an overview of social media and big data with a focus on deriving business intelligence for transit operators and planners. This course does not attempt to provide a complete treatment of social media, big data, or business intelligence, but rather focuses on the intersection of the three areas in relation to transit.
