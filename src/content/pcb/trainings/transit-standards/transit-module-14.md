The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) defines a common format for public transportation schedules and associated geographic information that is “open,” available, and widely adopted by transit agencies. GTFS “feeds” allow public transit agencies to publish their transit data and developers to write applications that consume that data in an interoperable way. GTFS is also a key component of Travel Information System (TIS).

Module 14 Part 1 covers static GTFS data such as schedule, bus stops, station and terminus information, and general fare policy data commonly utilized by transit agencies. This module provides an overview of GTFS and training about the structure and content of GTFS. Transit agency staff and their consultants will learn about how they can begin deploying the GTFS specification. The module will discuss the data content, data management, tools to implement the specification, and several case studies of agencies that generate and use the data specification. Additionally, the module will discuss how GTFS feeds can be used by third party developers, planners, and other users.
