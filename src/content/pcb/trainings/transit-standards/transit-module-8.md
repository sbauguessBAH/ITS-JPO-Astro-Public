Transit managers are looking at transit signal priority as a potential tool to improve schedule adherence, improve transit vehicle efficiency, make transit service more reliable, and improve transit vehicle travel times with minimal negative impacts to normal traffic operations. Signal Control Priority (SCP), which transit signal priority (TSP) is a subset of, is an operational strategy that provides preferential treatment (priority) to facilitate the movement of fleet vehicles such as transit, emergency service, and commercial fleets, through signalized intersections.

This module (Arterial Management and Transit Signal Priority: Understanding User Needs for Signal Control Priority (SCP) Based on the NTCIP 1211 Standard) is the first of a two-module set in arterial management. This module will introduce participants to the benefits of an SCP system, describe the components that may make up an SCP system, and provide an overview of how to identify and use applicable ITS standards to procure and operate an SCP system. This module also helps participants understand the scope of applicable ITS standards and assists in identifying the user needs of an SCP system. Although the discussion in the module will be for an SCP system in general, the focus will be on transit signal priority (TSP), which is a subset of SCP.

This module will also provide an example case study, demonstrating how a transit agency might work with a traffic signal department to select an architecture for an SCP system, determine the features to be included in the SCP system, and how to develop a procurement specification.

The second module of the two module-set on arterial management (Arterial Management and Transit Signal Priority: Specifying Requirements for Signal Control Priority (SCP) Based on NTCIP 1211 Standard) focuses on using the ITS standards to develop project specifications for procuring an SCP system.
