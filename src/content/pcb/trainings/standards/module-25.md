The focus of this module is to assist technical staff in specifying clear requirements from the list of requirements that exist in NTCIP 1210 v02 SSM Standard and meeting identified user needs. This module will continue to provide participants with information on how to identify the appropriate use of the NTCIP 1210 Standard and acquire a SSM system based on what the user is seeking to accomplish as identified by tracing the user needs to the requirements with support from tools and resources such as a Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) and Protocol Requirements List (PRL) in following a Systems Engineering Process (SEP).
