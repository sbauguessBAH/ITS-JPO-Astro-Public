This module will teach the student the general structure and parts of a TCS with representative examples, how test cases fit into the testing process and their relationship to the test plan, test design specification, and test procedures (as defined in IEEE 829). This module will also show students how to develop test cases to verify requirements for standards that have been through the SEP (ESS) and contain test documentation, and those that do not have SEP (ASC).
