Traffic Management Data Dictionary (TMDD) Standard v3.03 is an information level standard jointly developed and published by ITE and ASHTO to provide data elements necessary to build a communications interface between multiple centers to exchange information in real-time. Traffic Management Centers (TMCs) often implement such interfaces to communicate with other centers (external centers) within the overall ITS applications. Such applications are termed as Center-to-Center communications (C2C). Previously developed Modules A321 and A321b cover the details of TMDD user needs and requirements respectively.

The Center-to-Center (C2C) Reference Implementation (RI) is a tool developed under contract to the U.S. DOT that mimics an operational traffic management system that provides a Traffic Management Data Dictionary (TMDD) conformant interface to external systems. It supports all features defined in the recently updated TMDD v3.03 standard and serves as a useful development and testing tool to verify that the new software is able to interoperate with a known reference.

The focus of this module is to explain how to use the Center-to-Center (C2C) Reference Implementation (RI) to test a system for conformance to the TMDD v3.03 standard. It describes installation, configuration, operation, and reporting features of the software; it also alerts participants to the limitations of the software and the resources required for its proper use. This module is intended for hands-on users of the software. This module uses sample TMDD v3.03 data exchanges and explains how the tool can be used to verify that a deployed system conforms to the standardized exchanges as per TMDD v03.03 and NTCIP 2306 XML v1.69.
