This module assists user agencies in their efforts to create test documentation specific to their transportation sensor system (TSS) needs based on the NTCIP 1209 v02 Standard and will be based on the IEEE 829 architecture for testing. It will review both sample test documentation created prior to testing and sample test documentation produced after performing the tests. It will also guide agencies in verifying that delivered products comply with the agency's NTCIP specifications.

This module will help users leverage their NTCIP 1209 v02 based specifications (as described in Modules A312a and A312b) to produce sample Test Plans, Test Design Specifications (TDSs), Test Case Specifications (TCSs) and Test Procedure Specifications (TPSs) for their TSSs.
