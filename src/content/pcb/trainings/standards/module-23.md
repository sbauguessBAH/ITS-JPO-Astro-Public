The focus of this module is to assist technical staff in specifying clear requirements from the list of requirements that exist in NTCIP 1209 v02 TSS Standard and meeting identified user needs. This module will continue to provide participants with information on how to identify the appropriate use of the NTCIP 1209 Standard and acquire a TSS system based on what the user is seeking to accomplish as identified by tracing the user needs to the requirements with support from tools and resources such as a Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) and Protocol Requirements List (PRL) in following a Systems Engineering Process (SEP).

This module also helps the user understand the scope of the TSS Standard and in continuation with the previous module: A312a-Understanding User Needs for TSS Based on NTCIP 1209 Standard. This module is to be placed in the context of the SEP as well as in the acquisition curriculum path with I101, A101, A102, A201, and A312a being the prerequisites. This completes the acquisition life cycle leading to the user being able to write specifications.
