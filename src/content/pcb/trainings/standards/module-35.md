This module assists user agencies in their efforts to create test plans specific to their ASC needs based on the NTCIP 1202 v02 Standard. Prior to developing such a test plan, the user is expected to be knowledgeable of the NTCIP 1202 v02 Standard and testing methodologies. The agency is also expected to have developed their own user needs and requirements related to the NTCIP 1202 Standard.

This module will review sample test documentation that should result from performing the tests identified including test logs, test summary, and test incident reports.
