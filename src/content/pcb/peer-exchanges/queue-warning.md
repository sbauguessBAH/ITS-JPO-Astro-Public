### Are You Ready to Enhance Roadway Safety and Mobility?
The U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) invites you to participate in a series of virtual peer exchanges designed to share best practices and lessons learned in planning and deploying Queue Warning Systems (QWS).

---

### What Are Queue Warning Systems?
Queue Warning Systems are cutting-edge Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) that:
- **Improve safety** by reducing sudden braking and rear-end collisions.
- **Enhance mobility** by providing real-time alerts about upcoming traffic queues.
- **Leverage technology** like:
  - **Dynamic Message Signs (DMS)** for roadside alerts.
  - **Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)** for in-vehicle notifications.
  - **Predictive analytics** to anticipate queues using traffic and historical data.

---

### Why Participate?
By joining this peer exchange, you will:
- Learn from agencies that have successfully implemented QWS.
- Share your own successes and lessons learned.
- Discuss challenges and solutions collaboratively.
- Gain insights to support future deployments.
