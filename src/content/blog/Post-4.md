On behalf of the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT), the U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office (ITS JPO) ITS4US Deployment Program invites you to the upcoming webinar, ITS4US Deployment Program Phase 2 Webinar: Georgia Mobility and Accessibility Planner Replicability.

*This webinar is free and open to the public, but advance registration is required.*

Date: **14 August 2024**  
Time: **2:00 – 3:30 PM ET**  
Cost: **Free of charge** [**Register Here**](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/georgia-mobility-and-accessibility-planner-g-map-replicability-webinar-registration-938564490657?aff=oddtdtcreator)

### Webinar Topic

**<u>Georgia Mobility and Accessibility Planner (G-MAP) Replicability</u>**<u><br></u>**GDOT – Safe Trips in a Connected Transportation Network (ST-CTN)**

The ST-CTN project seeks to enhance the travel experience for underserved communities, including people with disabilities, older adults, and travelers with limited English proficiency (LEP) through the development of an open-sourced application called the Georgia Mobility and Accessibility Planner (G-MAP). The application will allow travelers to create a personalized trip plan to navigate physical infrastructure, resolve unexpected obstacles, and ensure visibility, and accessibility throughout their travel.

G-MAP, an open-source application, will be available for anyone around the country or internationally to leverage. As an illustration of how the G-MAP application will be used, transit-based trips were delineated into six segments to allow for easier understanding and a greater breakdown of priorities and goals. Key features and functionality available for replicability within each step will be shared during this webinar.

The webinar will discuss the following topics:

- Project Introduction
- Replicability Features, Functions, Resources (includes trip segments diagram)
    - Systems Engineering Documentation, OpenStreetMap, OpenTripPlanner, GitHub sites, pedestrian data, etc.
- Steps 1-6 Features and Functions Deep Dive

### Presenters

### Background

The ITS4US Deployment Program, led by the ITS JPO at the U.S. DOT, expands access to transportation for all travelers with a specific focus on underserved communities, including people with disabilities, older adults, veterans, individuals of low income, people in rural communities and those with limited English proficiency. This program embodies the Administration’s priorities of transportation equity, economic growth, sustainability, and most importantly, compassion and inclusivity. The program funds multiple large-scale replicable deployments in three phases:

- Phase 1: concept development
- Phase 2: design and testing
- Phase 3: operations and evaluation.

In June 2022, the deployment sites completed the concept development phase of each of their projects. The U.S. DOT awarded four teams with Phase 2 funding to support the design and testing of their projects based on their Phase 1 concepts. The four deployment sites are:

- GDOT
- Heart of Iowa Regional Transit Agency
- Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority/Buffalo
- University of Washington

For more details on the ITS4US Deployment program, see the program’s website at:** [https://its.dot.gov/its4us/](https://www.its.dot.gov/its4us/index.htm)**.

ITS JPO is hosting a series of free, public webinars to allow each of the four Phase 2 deployment sites to publicly share topics and experiences that would be of interest to deployers considering innovative technology solutions to solve mobility challenges of underserved communities. These webinars will be an opportunity for each site to discuss their experiences during the Design/Build Test/Phase and engage the broader ITS4US Deployment Program Community about their efforts so far in Phase 2. At the end of the presentation, there will be an opportunity for the audience to ask the site questions about their project. Future deployers can benefit from lessons learned and experiences from the ITS4US deployment teams.
