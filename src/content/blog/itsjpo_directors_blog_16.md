title: 'Encouraging Nationwide Advancement of Vehicle-to-Everything Deployment: A Thanksgiving Message from Brian Cronin'

As the end of the year approaches and we look forward to all of the incredible progress we plan to make in 2025, I wanted to stop today and share why **now** is the right time to begin vehicle-to-everything (V2X) deployment, the remarks Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Acting Administrator Kristin White recently gave regarding V2X deployment, and a message of my thanks and gratitude during this season.

First, it is important to remember** that the Saving Lives with Connectivity: National V2X Deployment Plan **is a resource that deployers (and future deployers) can use now. The National V2X Deployment Plan provides a vision of how V2X deployments will enable a safer, secure, and more efficient transportation system, while maintaining privacy and consumer protection, with the goal of reducing the number of roadway fatalities to the only acceptable number: zero.

We want deployers to know **there are standards **to encourage the widespread use of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) technologies in surface transportation systems. The [**ITS Standards Program**](https://www.standards.its.dot.gov/ "ITS  Standards Program") is actively teaming with standards development organizations (SDOs) to update and improve V2X standards while working with stakeholders on standards-based ITS implementation strategies. V2X standards continue to evolve over time as we learn from deployments.

V2X** funding is available **for deployers across the country. In June, the U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) awarded nearly $60 million in advanced technology grants to deployments in Arizona, Texas, and Utah. Just weeks ago, FHWA announced more than $96 million in grants to 20 projects in 16 states under the Advanced Transportation Technology and Innovation (ATTAIN) program. Additional funding programs and resources can be found in the [**V2X Funding Fact**](https://www.its.dot.gov/scrc/assets/V2X-Formula-and-Grant-Funding-Sources_10-16-2024.pdf) Sheet through the [**Smart Community Resource Center**](https://www.its.dot.gov/scrc/).

And did you know there are** communities that have already started deploying and you can learn from their experience**? The Accelerating V2X Cohort of public agencies shares best practices, challenges, lessons learned, and other knowledge as they advance V2X deployment. For more information on the Accelerating V2X Cohort, or to join the growing community of over 50 cohort members, please contact J.D. Schneeberger at [**John.Schneeberger@dot.gov**](mailto:John.Schneeberger@dot.gov). You can also view the dozens of planned and experimental V2X deployments on the** [V2X Deployment Map](https://www.its.dot.gov/scrc/assets/CVlocations_USA_map_Sept_2024.pdf)**.

There is also** free training **available as part of the ITS Professional Capacity Building (PCB) Program. The [**PCB Program**](https://www.its.dot.gov/pcb/) is U.S. DOT’s primary mechanism for educating today’s (and tomorrow’s) transportation workforce about current and future intelligent transportation technology. The program assists transportation professionals, educators, and students in developing their knowledge, skills, and abilities to build technical proficiency while furthering their career paths.

With the release of the National V2X Deployment Plan in August**, this is an opportunity for you to be a visionary leader in the ITS industry while saving lives.**

I also wanted to share FHWA Acting Administrator Kristin White’s nationwide challenge to accelerate V2X deployment. We encourage each of you to advance V2X in your own state. New V2X deployers can leverage the U.S. DOT’s technical assistance opportunities, including V2X trainings held throughout the year and through the Smart Community Resource Center, which has a wealth of information that can be referenced and accessed whenever needed.

For quality operational decision-making, several resources are available in support of data quality, including the **[Work Zone Data Exchange (WZDx)](https://www.transportation.gov/av/data/wzdx) **and the WZDx Cohort, as well as the [**ITS Deployment Evaluation Program**](https://www.itskrs.its.dot.gov/).

We encourage you to make a commitment to deploy V2X on at least one roadway in your state. Perhaps you already have plans to procure a device; if not, the Turner Fairbank Highway Research Center offers an [**Equipment Loan and Help Desk for V2X**](https://www.its.dot.gov/pcb/CV_deployer_resources.aspx#equipmentLoan). You can borrow devices and get help with setup, maintenance and data analysis.

Remember, V2X includes not only physical infrastructure, but also cloud-based and network-supported feeds that collect various data. Institutionalize V2X in your state. Ensuring and committing to V2X in Transportation Improvement Programs (TIPs) reflects your commitment to innovation and planning for the future.

As we approach the Thanksgiving holiday, I want to express my thanks to all for the incredible year we’ve had in 2024. I am sincerely grateful to my ITS JPO colleagues for continuing to evolve and move so many innovative programs forward, to our partners and deployers for their innovation and investment in the future, and to all who continue to join us as we create a safer and more reliable transportation network for all road users.

**Brian Cronin, Director, ITS JPO**
