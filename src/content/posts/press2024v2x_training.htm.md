The U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) is committed to accelerating the successful deployment of interoperable vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies to realize transportation system benefits, especially in safety and efficiency. These technologies offer the potential to make significant impacts in improving safety, enhancing mobility, and reducing transportation's impact on the environment.

To prepare the workforce for this transformative technology, the [**Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office (ITS JPO)**](https://www.its.dot.gov/index.htm) has developed and is offering a new, in-person introductory V2X training. This foundational-level course equips participants with a basic understanding of V2X concepts. Participants will be introduced to key components that enable a V2X ecosystem, learn about potential benefits of the technology, and explore example use cases and the messages and standards that support them while ensuring safety and privacy. Intended for participants that are new to V2X, the course will cover:

1.  The Case for Interoperable Connectivity
2.  V2X Basics
3.  U.S. DOT V2X Technical Assistance and Resources

The first in-person training will be delivered at the ITS America Annual Meeting in Phoenix, Arizona, on **Thursday, April 25, 2024,** from 1:00 to 5:00 pm MT. To register for the free training, click [**here**](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/foundational-vehicle-to-everything-v2x-training-tickets-857080038467?aff=oddtdtcreator). The target audience for this training includes transportation professionals with an interest in V2X. This introductory course targets individuals new to V2X concepts as well as individuals interested in refreshing their knowledge of key V2X concepts. No prior V2X experience is required to attend this training.

In addition to the delivery of this training at the ITSA Annual Meeting, the ITS JPO is working with [**ITS America**](https://itsa.org/) to deliver the training in collaboration with ITS State Chapters. Entities interested in learning more about V2X training opportunities should contact J.D. Schneeberger (ITS JPO) at [**john.schneeberger@dot.gov**](mailto:john.schneeberger@dot.gov).

In the future, the ITS JPO plans to develop and deliver additional V2X trainings that will cover a variety of technical topics.
