title: "ITS4US Deployment Program Phase 2 Webinar - Hybrid System Engineering Series: The Role of Stakeholder Engagement in the Deployment of a Complex System – The Buffalo All Access Approach"
date: 2024-02-06
---

### Presented by Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority

**Hybrid System Engineering Series-Buffalo All Access Approach**

The deployment in Buffalo will integrate accessible trip planning with current Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority (NFTA) transit services, incorporate an on-demand shuttle which will be the first of its kind in the region, have indoor and outdoor wayfinding, install intersection safety technologies for travelers and develop a website/mobile platform that factors in traveler preferences and accessibility needs. With this complex system deployment, which involves interoperability dependencies and multiple system development methods, the engineering approach could become very complicated and messy. This webinar will focus on two parts: the important role of stakeholder (end users and infrastructure owners/operators) engagement in developing and deploying a multi-system, multimodal system, and the hybrid System Engineering/ Agile used to accommodate such active stakeholder engagement.

**Date:** February 29, 2024  
**Time:** 2:00 to 3:30 pm ET  
**Presenters:** Elina Zlotchenko, ITS JPO/FHWA; Robert Jones (NFTA), Jamie Hamann-Burney (BNMC), Polly Okunieff (ICF), Nayel Urena Serulle (ICF)

The ITS4US Deployment Program, led by the ITS JPO  at the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT), expands access to transportation for all travelers with a specific focus on underserved communities, including people with disabilities, older adults, veterans, individuals of low income, people in rural communities and those with limited English proficiency. This program embodies the Administration’s priorities of transportation equity, economic growth, sustainability, and most importantly, compassion and inclusivity. The program funds multiple large-scale replicable deployments in three phases:

-   Phase 1: concept development
-   Phase 2: design and testing
-   Phase 3: operations and evaluation.

In June 2022, the deployment sites completed the concept development phase of each of their projects. The USDOT awarded four teams with Phase 2 funding to support the design and testing of their projects based on their Phase 1 concepts. The four deployment sites are:

-   Georgia Department of Transportation 
-   Heart of Iowa Regional Transit Agency
-   NFTA/Buffalo
-   University of Washington

For more details on the ITS4US Deployment program, see the program’s website at: [**https://its.dot.gov/its4us/**](https://www.its.dot.gov/its4us/index.htm).

ITS JPO is hosting a series of free, public webinars to allow each of the four Phase 2 deployment sites to publicly share topics and experiences that would be of interest to deployers considering innovative technology solutions to solve mobility challenges of underserved communities. These webinars will be an opportunity for each site to discuss their experiences during the Design/Build Test/Phase and engage the broader ITS4US Deployment Program Community about their efforts so far in Phase 2. At the end of the presentation, there will be an opportunity for the audience to ask the site questions about their project. Future deployers can benefit from lessons learned and experiences from the ITS4US deployment teams.

Please use the link below to register for the webinar. Live closed captioning will be provided for all webinars. When registering for the webinar, you will be able to request additional accessibility accommodations to participate. The deadline to request accommodations for each webinar will be <u>5 business days</u> prior to the live event.
