Amazon Alexa home devices and enabled vehicles are now able to receive road condition and travel information directly from the Wyoming Department of Transportation (WYDOT).

Travelers who rely on WYDOT 511 services for up-to-date road information now have a hands-free option at home or on the road. By leveraging work done under a federal grant for connected vehicle technology, WYDOT joined the ranks of other innovative DOTs, including New Jersey DOT, making 511 travel information available for third-party users.

The hands-free Alexa application can directly connect to WYDOTâ€™s road condition information. As a result, the application can provide information about road closures, general road conditions, and road constructions.
