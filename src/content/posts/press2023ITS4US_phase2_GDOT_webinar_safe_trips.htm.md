## ITS4US Deployment Program Phase 2 Webinar: Hybrid System Development with Stakeholder Support - Presented by Georgia Department of Transportation – Safe Trips in a Connected Transportation Network

### Hybrid System Development with Stakeholder Support

Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) – Safe Trips in a Connected Transportation Network (ST-CTN)

This webinar will focus on the system development process and how we engage stakeholder input throughout the process to ensure the system will meet user needs.

The ST-CTN project employed a robust systems engineering process that used the U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) “Vee” diagram combined with an Agile Development process to guide system development and incremental design while soliciting stakeholder input throughout the process. The webinar will describe the Systems Engineering (SE)/Agile hybrid process and the milestones used to engage stakeholders. The webinar will discuss the following topics:

-   Hybrid systems development process

-   SE Process
-   Agile Development Process

-   Stakeholder engagement throughout the process (from concept to deployment)

-   Needs Identification Outreach
-   Walkthroughs (ConOps, System Requirements, System Architecture, Design)
-   Design Workshops
-   Release Demonstrations

-   Ongoing engagement and recruitment

**Date:** Tuesday, November 14, 2023  
**Time:** 2:00 to 3:30 pm ET

**Presenters:** Norah Ocel, Federal Highway Administration; Polly Okunieff, GO Systems and Solutions, ITS4US ST-CTN System Engineering Lead; Bennett Foster, Atlanta Regional Commission, ITS4US Co-Deployment Lead; Jordan Ashley Hall, Statewide Independent Living Council of Georgia, ITS4US ST-CTN Community Outreach Lead; and Natalie Smusz-Mengelkoch, ICF, ITS4US Co-Deployment Lead.

The ITS4US Deployment Program, led by the Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office (ITS JPO) at the U.S. DOT, expands access to transportation for all travelers with a specific focus on underserved communities, including people with disabilities, older adults, veterans, individuals of low income, people in rural communities and those with limited English proficiency. This program embodies the Administration’s priorities of transportation equity, economic growth, sustainability, and most importantly, compassion and inclusivity. The program funds multiple large-scale replicable deployments in three phases:

-   Phase 1: concept development
-   Phase 2: design and testing
-   Phase 3: operations and evaluation

In June 2022, the deployment sites completed the concept development phase of each of their projects. The U.S. DOT awarded four teams with Phase 2 funding to support the design and testing of their projects based on their Phase 1 concepts. The four deployment sites are:

-   GDOT
-   Heart of Iowa Regional Transit Agency
-   Niagara Frontier Transit Authority/Buffalo
-   University of Washington

For more details on the ITS4US Deployment program, see the program’s website at: [**https://its.dot.gov/its4us/**](https://www.its.dot.gov/its4us/index.htm).  
The ITS JPO is hosting a series of free, public webinars to allow each of the four Phase 2 deployment sites to publicly share topics and experiences that would be of interest to deployers considering innovative technology solutions to solve mobility challenges of underserved communities. These webinars will be an opportunity for each site to discuss their experiences during the Design/Build Test/Phase and engage the broader ITS4US Deployment Program Community about their efforts so far in Phase 2. At the end of the presentation, there will be an opportunity for the audience to ask the site questions about their project. Future deployers can benefit from lessons learned and experiences from the ITS4US deployment teams.

Please use the link below to register for the webinar. Live closed captioning will be provided for all webinars. When registering for the webinar, you will be able to request additional accessibility accommodations to participate. The deadline to request accommodations for each webinar will be **5 business days** prior to the live event.
