he U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) is committed to reducing deaths and serious injuries on our nationâ€™s roadways. Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technology, sometimes referred to as connected vehicles or interoperable connectivity, is a powerful tool for achieving this goal. V2X systems enable vehicles to communicate with each other, with other road users, and with roadside infrastructure through wirelessly exchanged messages, with a broad range of safety applications.

For state and local agencies looking to deploy V2X technology in the short term, federal funding support can be a significant factor. To encourage deployment, the U.S. DOT has released a [**funding fact sheet**](https://www.its.dot.gov/scrc/assets/V2X-Formula-and-Grant-Funding-Sources_10-16-2024.pdf) providing information on potential federal sources of funding for V2X system planning, implementation, and operations under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

Several federal funding sources are available to aid projects financially throughout the deployment process and even continuing operations. The fact sheet includes details about multiple Federal Formula Funding opportunities as well as U.S. DOT Discretionary Grant Funding opportunities. This fact sheet is not meant to be a full funding breakdown, nor guidance, but rather serves as a resource for agencies to increase awareness and get started.

The fact sheet, [**Federal Highway Formula and Grant Funding Sources Available for V2X**](https://www.its.dot.gov/scrc/assets/V2X-Formula-and-Grant-Funding-Sources_10-16-2024.pdf), is now available at the [**Smart Community Resource Center**](https://www.its.dot.gov/scrc), which is a website designed to connect States, Tribal governments, and local communities with resources that can be used to develop intelligent transportation systems and smart community transportation programs. For more information on V2X applications, please visit the [**Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office (ITS JPO) website**](https://www.its.dot.gov/index.htm).
