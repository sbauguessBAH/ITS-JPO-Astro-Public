The U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) will host a second vehicle-to-everything (V2X) workshop called "Developing a Plan for Enhancing Safety Through Interoperable Connectivity." This event will take place on April 28, 2023 at the [**Gaylord Texan Resort & Convention Center**](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/dalgt-gaylord-texan-resort-and-convention-center/overview/) in Grapevine, Texas following the ITS America Conference and Expo, and it will serve us a follow-up to the U.S. DOT V2X Communications Summit held in August 2022.

This workshop will build on the stakeholder inputs received during and since the [**August 2022 V2X Communications Summit**](https://www.its.dot.gov/research_areas/emerging_tech/htm/ITS_V2X_CommunicationSummit.htm) to continue the conversation towards developing a national, coordinated deployment plan to enhance safety through interoperable connectivity. The focus of this workshop is on stakeholder collaboration to shape the plan and add detail to a draft Plan Framework that is focused on practical steps to build toward nationwide deployment of the V2X communications technologies and supporting systems. The draft agenda includes:

-   Summary of progress since the August 2022 V2X Communications Summit
-   Call to action to launch V2X deployments
-   Overview of the Plan’s framework
-   Breakout sessions to provide further input with the objective of drafting the Plan’s contents after the workshop.

The workshop will be hosted by Dr. Robert C. Hampshire, U.S. DOT's Deputy Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology and Chief Science Officer; Mr. Martin Knopp, Associate Administrator for Operations of the Federal Highway Administration; and Mr. Egan Smith, Managing Director of the Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office.

This event will offer both in-person and virtual attendance options. Please note that the in-person attendance may be limited to 225 attendees. If intending to participate in person, please register by April 14, 2023.
