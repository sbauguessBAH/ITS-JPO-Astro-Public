Visit Booth #852 at the 2023 Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting to learn more about how the ITS4US deployment sites are designing and testing innovative technologies to provide more efficient, affordable, and accessible mobility options for all travelers in their communities.

Be sure to join the Standing Committee on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ACP15) on Tuesday, January 10Â in the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, Salon C from 6:00 to 8:00 pm ET. Attendees will hear from the ITS4US Program Manager Elina Zlotchenko, as well as speakers from each of the four deployment sites.

The ITS4US Deployment Program is a U.S. Department of Transportation multimodal effort that identifies ways to provide more efficient, affordable, and accessible transportation options for underserved communities that often face greater challenges in accessing essential services. ITS4US aims to solve mobility challenges for all travelers with a specific focus on underserved communities, including people with disabilities, older adults, low-income individuals, rural residents, veterans, and limited English proficiency travelers. This program will enable communities to build local partnerships and develop and deploy integrated and replicable mobility solutions to achieve complete trips for all travelers.
