The U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) will host a webinar to share the performance measurement from the New York City (NYC) Connected Vehicle Pilot and the transition plan from its Phase III operations. The NYC CV Pilot has deployed over 450 RSUs and 3,000 Aftermarket Safety Devices (ASDs) in vehicles running 13 Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) applications focused on safety. This webinar will provide an overview of the performance evaluation of the deployed CV applications in NYC’s urban canyon environment. It will also discuss NYC’s plans for the next phase of the project after completion of the CV Pilot’s Phase III operations.

**Date/Time**: Wednesday December 15, 2021; 2:00 P.M. – 3:00 P.M. ET

Sponsored by the USDOT Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office (ITS JPO), the Connected Vehicle Pilot Deployment Program is a national effort to deploy, test, and operationalize cutting-edge mobile and roadside technologies and enable multiple connected vehicle applications. These innovative technologies and applications have the potential for immediate beneficial impacts – to save lives, improve personal mobility, enhance economic productivity, reduce negative environmental impacts, and transform public agency operations.

The USDOT selected three agencies as CV Pilot deployment sites: the Wyoming Department of Transportation (WYDOT), the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT), and the Tampa Hillsborough Expressway Authority (THEA). Each site prepared a comprehensive deployment concept to ensure a rapid and efficient connected vehicle capability roll-out. The sites then worked to design, build, and test these deployments of integrated wireless in-vehicle, mobile device, and roadside technologies. Now the NYCDOT Pilot is nearing the completion of the operational phase, where the tested system was operated and maintained in good working order over a period of 12 months and monitored on a set of key performance metrics to measure its impact.
