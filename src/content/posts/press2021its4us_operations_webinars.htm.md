The Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Joint Program Office (JPO) is hosting a series of five free public Complete Trip – ITS4US Deployment Program webinars to share the Concept of Operations for each of its deployment sites. The webinars will be held from July 14 to August 4, 2021. See below for dates, times, and registration links for each webinar.

### Background

In early 2021, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) launched the Complete Trip – ITS4US Deployment Program that aims to solve mobility challenges for all travelers—regardless of location, income, or disability—with accessing jobs, education, healthcare, and other activities.

This program is a multimodal, multi-year, effort led by the ITS JPO with support from the Office of the Secretary of Transportation, Federal Transit Administration, and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to enable communities to showcase innovative business partnerships, technologies, and practices that promote independent mobility for all. The program awarded $40 million to five sites to participate in Phase 1 of the program to plan and conceptualize their large-scale, replicable, real world deployments of integrated innovative technologies to address the challenges of planning and executing complete trips. For more details on the Complete Trip – ITS4US Deployment Program, visit the program’s [**website**](https://www.its.dot.gov/its4us/index.htm).

### Webinar Details

The ITS JPO is hosting a set of five free public webinars to allow each of the five deployment sites to publicly share their Concept of Operations, which are being developed as part of Phase 1. This will be an opportunity for each site to discuss the main barriers to complete trips that their deployment aims to overcome, deployment concepts, and stakeholder engagement efforts that have been conducted so far in Phase 1. At the end of the presentation, there will be an opportunity for the audience to ask questions.

Each webinar will be held from 1:30 PM to 3:00 PM (EDT) and will feature a different site. Please use the links below to register for each webinar separately. Live closed captioning will be provided for all webinars. When registering for a webinar, you will be able to indicate if you need any disability accommodations to participate. The deadline to request accommodations for each webinar will be 5 business days prior to the live event.
