-   [**Traffic Optimization for Signalized Corridors Phase 2 Functional Safety Concept and Hazard Analysis Final Report (FHWA-JPO-22-961)**](https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/64925) - This report details a step-by-step framework developed in accordance with the process defined in ISO 26262 and provides a summary and findings of the functional safety analysis.
-   [**Incorporating Automated Vehicles (AV) into Scenario Planning Models (FHWA-JPO-22-926)**](https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/66970) - This report presents the findings of a project tasked with integrating AVs into the modeling process to develop metrics, models, and prototype tools for quantitative evaluation of AV scenario planning impacts.
-   [**Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Intelligence Transportation Systems (ITS) Challenges and Potential Solutions, Insights, and Lessons Learned (FHWA-JPO-22-968)**](https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/66971) - This report focus on the the implications of AI adoption and implementation for ITS as well as insights that agencies could consider in helping to mitigate any challenges.
-   [**System Dynamics Models of Automated Vehicle Impacts (FHWA-JPO-22-985)**](https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/66972) - This report presents a project that developed causal loop diagrams for several “building blocks” (archetypes) that affect how automated vehicles might be used, including new product adoption, sustainability of business model, mode choice, scale effects, congestion, and residential relocation.
