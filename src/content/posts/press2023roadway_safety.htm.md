## U.S. Department of Transportation's ITS Deployment Evaluation Program Adds New Topics to the Spotlight on ITS for Roadway Safety Web Pages

The U.S. Department of Transportation's (U.S. DOT) top priority is safety. The U.S. DOT [**National Roadway Safety Strategy**](https://www.transportation.gov/NRSS) outlines the Safe System Approach as the guiding paradigm to reduce serious injuries and deaths on our Nation’s highways, roads, and streets. Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) can support these objectives and help in reaching the goal of zero roadway fatalities.

The ITS Joint Program Office’s ITS Deployment Evaluation Program has added three new safety topics to the [**Spotlight on ITS for Roadway Safety**](https://www.itskrs.its.dot.gov/safety) web pages: road weather safety, transit safety, and traffic incident management safety. The Spotlight on ITS for Roadway Safety web pages contain a variety of evaluation products organized by safety category to support informed decision-making. Current topics include pedestrian safety, work zone safety, and roadway safety, in addition to the three most recent additions. We invite you to explore the safety topics to learn more about how ITS has been proven to improve safety.
