This month, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued Public Notices (PNs) and docket filings about use of the **[5.9 GHz Safety Band](https://www.transportation.gov/safety-band/recent-fcc-public-notices)** that may be of interest to transportation stakeholders:

-   **Transitioning from the Lower 45 MHz**: The FCC published a reminder about transitioning by July 5, 2022. The PN provides guidance on how intelligent transportation systems (ITS) licensees will notify the Bureau by July 20, 2022, about the ceasing of their operations in the lower 45 MHz and moving Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) operations into the upper 30 MHz or ceasing operations. The PN also includes information on how to contact the FCC with questions. ITS licensees may also want to check to ensure that their current licenses for using channels in the lower 45 MHz are transitioned—by the FCC—to the upper 30 MHz. The link to the FCC PN on transitioning is here: [**https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-22-612A1.pdf**](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-22-612A1.pdf).
-   **Long-Term Evolution (LTE) Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) Waiver Requests**: The FCC has posted three LTE-C-V2X waiver requests and has asked the public for comments within 30 days of each waiver being published in the Federal Register. (The U.S. Department of Transportation will update the [**5.9 GHz Safety Band site**](https://www.transportation.gov/content/safety-band) with Federal Register publication.) With each PN, the Bureau seeks comments on each request, including supplemental materials and notes provided by each filer, including specific technical information on each State's proposed C-V2X installations and operations. The waivers are from:
    -   The Departments of Transportation (DOTs) of the State of Florida and State of Georgia and the State of Maryland State Highway Administration, each requesting a waiver of the Commission’s rules to operate roadside units (RSUs) with C-V2X-based technology in the upper 30 MHz (5.895-5.925 GHz) portion of the 5.850-5.925 GHz (5.9 GHz) band under its Part 90 ITS license. **[https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-22-617A1.pdf](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-22-617A1.pdf)**.
    -   A set of automakers, State DOTs, and equipment manufacturers (collectively, the C-V2X Joint Waiver Parties) including Audi of America, Inc., Ford Motor Company, Jaguar Land Rover, the Utah Department of Transportation, the Virginia Department of Transportation, AAEON Technology Inc., Advantech Co., Ltd., Applied Information, Inc., Cohda Wireless Pty Ltd., Commsignia, Inc., Danlaw Inc., HARMAN International Industries, Inc., Kapsch TrafficCom USA Inc., and Panasonic Corporation of North America. https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-22-611A1.pdf.
    -   Drive Ohio has requested similar consideration. **[https://files.fcc.gov/ecfs/download/80f3ffd6-467f-480b-93f9-2b750dfa7303?orig=true&pk=cb77b2ec-1a58-dbc6-139b-ad192cfd5d9b](https://files.fcc.gov/ecfs/download/80f3ffd6-467f-480b-93f9-2b750dfa7303?orig=true&pk=cb77b2ec-1a58-dbc6-139b-ad192cfd5d9b)**.

Information on providing comments to the FCC is included in each PN. As a reminder, the FCC’s docket with current/historical postings is located at: **[https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/search-filings/results?q=(%22Use%20of%20the%205.850-5.925%20GHz%20Band%22)](https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/search-filings/results?q=(%22Use%20of%20the%205.850-5.925%20GHz%20Band%22))**.
