title: Free Public Webinar on the Tampa Hillsborough Expressway Authority (THEA) Connected Vehicle Pilot - Deployment Results and Transition Plan
date: 2021-01-11
---

The U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) will host a webinar to share the deployment performance results from the THEA Connected Vehicle Pilot and the plan to migrate the current pilot to Connected Vehicle Real-World Test Site (CVRTS). The activities in the plan include dual mode Roadside Units (RSUs) with Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) and Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) capabilities, spectrum interference testing support and direct Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) participation to demonstrate interoperability with OEM devices.

**Date/Time:** Monday, January 25, 2021; 12:00 P.M. – 1:30 P.M. ET

Sponsored by the USDOT Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office (ITS JPO), the Connected Vehicle Pilot Deployment Program is a national effort to deploy, test, and operationalize cutting-edge mobile and roadside technologies and enable multiple connected vehicle applications. These innovative technologies and applications have the potential for immediate beneficial impacts – to save lives, improve personal mobility, enhance economic productivity, reduce negative environmental impacts, and transform public agency operations.

The USDOT selected three agencies as CV Pilot deployment sites: the Wyoming Department of Transportation (WYDOT), the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT), and the Tampa Hillsborough Expressway Authority (THEA). Each site prepared a comprehensive deployment concept to ensure a rapid and efficient connected vehicle capability roll-out. The sites then worked to design, build, and test these deployments of integrated wireless in-vehicle, mobile device, and roadside technologies. Now the THEA Pilot has completed the operational phase, where the tested system was operated and maintained in good working order over a period of 18 months and monitored on a set of key performance metrics to measure its impact.
