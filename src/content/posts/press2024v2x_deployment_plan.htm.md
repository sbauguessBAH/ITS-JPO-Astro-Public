The opportunity to provide your valuable input on the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (U.S. DOT) Draft National Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) Deployment Plan will close on January 31, 2024.

U.S. DOT invites all stakeholders to read the [**draft plan**](https://www.its.dot.gov/research_areas/emerging_tech/pdf/Accelerate_V2X_Deployment.pdf) and to email your thoughts to [**V2XDeploymentPlan@dot.gov**](mailto:V2XDeploymentPlan@dot.gov). Your comments will help the U.S. DOT establish a practical path towards a nationwide, interoperable V2X ecosystem.  
Comments related to the following questions are particularly helpful:

-   What is your reaction to the plan?
-   What do you like about it?
-   What is missing?
-   What would you change?
-   What resources do you feel are needed to help scale and deploy V2X technology?
-   What would you like to see in the short term (the next 2-3 years) from other stakeholders, including both U.S. DOT and the public/private sectors?

The Final National V2X Deployment Plan is expected to be released in the spring of 2024.
