### Presented by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office

**Date:** June 27, 2024  
**Time:** 2:00 to 3:15 pm ET

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Enabled Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and Readiness Checklists**

**Presenters:** Robert Sheehan, ITS Joint Program Office (JPO)/Federal Highway Administration; David Hale (Leidos), Brandon Freeman (TrustThink), Mohammed Hadi (Florida International University)

The U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) recognizes the promise AI offers for achieving considerable benefits in ITS, such as improving safety, mobility, equity, efficiency, accessibility, productivity, resilience, and reducing individual and societal costs, emissions, and other negative environmental impacts. Several industries use CMMs to objectively assess an organization’s processes and ability to execute activities in the scope of the CMM topic area. This document provides an AI-enabled ITS CMM as an approach for organizations to self-assess their strengths and weaknesses for incorporating and mainstreaming AI into their ITS programs and operational processes. The AI-enabled ITS CMM fills a gap for transportation professionals by providing a more rigorous assessment (via comprehensive readiness checklists) compared to existing AI CMMs developed by commercial technology companies. Importantly, stakeholders helped to define capability maturity levels within the AI-enabled ITS CMM, which helped to inform the resulting readiness checklist items developed by the research team. Specifically, stakeholders noted the importance of a Level 2 (out of 4) maturity to denote organizations that have made the proper steps to achieve AI-enabled ITS readiness but have not yet deployed AI-enabled ITS solutions. In addition, stakeholders recommended explicit recognition of a “level zero” maturity, because a large proportion of organizations have no awareness and/or capability within certain AI dimensions and/or subdimensions at this time of this writing.

**AI-Based Decision Support System (DSS) and Traffic Operations Strategic Plan**

**Presenter:** Mena Lockwood (Virginia Department of Transportation), Candice Gibson (Virginia Department of Transportation)

This presentation will highlight the VDOT Traffic Operations Strategic Plan that is currently under development and discuss high-level strategies recommended for implementing emerging technologies such as AI. A flagship example is Regional Multi-Modal Mobility Program (RM3P) awarding the much-anticipated project, Artificial Intelligence-Based Decision Support System (AI-DSS), in October 2023 ([**https://rm3pvirginia.org/2024/03/rm3p-hits-a-major-milestone-ai-dss-awarded/**](https://rm3pvirginia.org/2024/03/rm3p-hits-a-major-milestone-ai-dss-awarded/)). The AI-DSS will improve collaborative responses to incidents.

**Applications of AI in Transportation Planning**

**Presenter:** Eric Hill (Florida Department of Transportation)

In October 2023, FDOT’s TSMO Advisory Committee received a presentation on the aforementioned AI-Enabled ITS CMM and Readiness Checklists. This brings to mind “The Coming Wave: Technology, Power, and the Twenty-First Century’s Greatest Dilemma,” by Sulyman Hustafa. This presentation will discuss the application of AI in transportation planning plus thoughts on the AI-ITS CMM’s usefulness, and what guidance may be helpful for public agencies.
