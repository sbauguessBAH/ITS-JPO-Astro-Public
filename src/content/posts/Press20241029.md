WASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) announced more than $96.5 million in grants to 16 states for 20 projects under the Advanced Transportation Technology and Innovation (ATTAIN) program. As part of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, the grants will fund technology-based and multimodal solutions that improve the travel experience for millions of Americans who use our highway and transit systems, including in disadvantaged communities that have lacked investment and resources.

“The Biden-Harris Administration continues to advance projects that are modernizing the transportation sector and improving access, efficiency, and safety for all travelers,” said **U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg**. “With this latest round of funding, we’re helping states across the country develop the innovative, multimodal solutions that will make travel on our highways and transit systems easier, safer, and more convenient."

The program promotes advanced technologies to improve safety and reduce travel times for drivers and transit riders that can serve as national examples of innovation to improve transportation options for all communities.

“These projects are a critical opportunity to invest in our future, by leveraging technology and innovation,” noted **Acting Federal Highway Administrator Kristin White**. “These investments offer new and transformative transportation options, including communities who have lacked efficient and affordable means of transportation.”

Examples of projects selected to receive funding include the following:

- The California Department of Transportation will receive $5.6 million for its Interoperable Vehicle-to-Everything and connected vehicle infrastructure.
- Hillsborough County in Florida will receive $2.96 million to integrate smart traffic technology to improve safety, mobility, and connected vehicle readiness along 40-miles of arterial streets within Hillsborough County.
- The City of Cedar Park in Texas will receive $4.42 million to address traffic congestion and enhance road user safety through the rapid deployment of advanced transportation technology – including, Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication and Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications.

Overall, the 20 selected projects will help advance Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) technologies that improve mobility and safety. The projects include state-of-the art systems – including signal timing that works with transit and light rail, pedestrian and intersection safety, trip planning and ITS traffic management. Earlier this year the Department announced the [**Saving Lives with Connectivity: A Plan to Accelerate V2X Deployment**](https://highways.dot.gov/newsroom/usdot-releases-national-deployment-plan-vehicle-everything-v2x-technologies-reduce-death). This plan will guide the implementation of vehicle-to-everything technologies across the nation and support USDOT’s commitment to pursue a comprehensive approach to reduce the number of roadway fatalities to zero.
