title: National Telecommunications and Information Administration to Host Two Listening Sessions on the National Spectrum Strategy
date: 2023-03-23
---

The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) will hold two public listening sessions to assist in its preparation of a National Spectrum Strategy (NSS) for the United States. The first listening session will be held on March 30, 2023 from 1:00 to 4:00 pm EDT in Washington, DC. The second listening session will be held on April 11, 2023 from 1:00 to 3:30 pm EDT in Notre Dame, IN.

The NTIA is seeking input from the public as it develops a NSS that identifies the actions needed to maximize the potential of our nation’s spectrum resources. Access to spectrum contributes to technological innovation and economic growth and is critical to national security, public safety, and other national priorities.

Both listening sessions will be open to the public and the press and will use a public hearing format. Speakers will be given the opportunity to deliver oral presentations of approximately five minutes. Slides and other visual presentations cannot be accommodated. The agendas and other information regarding the events will be posted at [**https://ntia.gov/issues/national-spectrum-strategy/listening-session#**](https://ntia.gov/issues/national-spectrum-strategy/listening-session#).
