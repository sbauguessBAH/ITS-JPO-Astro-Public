The U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) will host a [**webinar**](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/wyoming-dot-cv-pilot-webinar-deployment-results-and-lessons-learned-registration-347997318347) to share the performance findings and lessons learned from the Wyoming DOT Connected Vehicle (CV) Pilot. The webinar will also share Wyoming DOT’s next steps and the path forward with the CV Pilot. The webinar will be held on Tuesday, June 28, 2022, at 1:00 pm EDT.

### Background

Sponsored by the U.S. DOT Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office (ITS JPO), the **[Connected Vehicle Pilot Deployment Program](https://www.its.dot.gov/pilots/index.htm)** is a national effort to deploy, test, and operationalize cutting-edge mobile and roadside technologies and enable multiple connected vehicle applications. These innovative technologies and applications have the potential for immediate beneficial impacts – to save lives, improve personal mobility, enhance economic productivity, reduce negative environmental impacts, and transform public agency operations.

The U.S. DOT selected three agencies as Connected Vehicle Pilot deployment sites: the Wyoming DOT, the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT), and Tampa Hillsborough Expressway Authority (THEA). The CV Pilot Demonstration Program designed for three phases: Phase 1 – Planning, Phase 2 – System Design and Build, and Phase 3 – Demonstration. Each site prepared a comprehensive deployment concept to ensure a rapid and efficient connected vehicle capability roll-out. The sites then worked to design, build, and test these deployments of integrated wireless in-vehicle, mobile device, and roadside technologies. NYCDOT and THEA have completed Phase 3.

Now, the WYDOT Pilot is completing Phase 3 that includes a real-world demonstration of the applications developed as part of this pilot, and data collection to monitor a set of key performance metrics to measure its impact.

### Webinar Details

The webinar will share the WYDOT Pilot’s accomplishments, performance results, lessons learned, and highlight activities in the transition plan to continue the efforts of the CV Pilot in providing high-quality weather, work zone, and road closure information to travelers in Wyoming.
