## Intersection Safety Challenge Stage 1A Deadline is Approaching on September 25

There is still time to participate in [**Stage 1A (Concept Assessment) of the Intersection Safety Challenge Prize Competition**](https://www.challenge.gov/?challenge=us-dot-intersection-safety-challenge). Submissions are open until September 25, 2023, at **5:00 pm EDT**. With up to **$1 million in prize winnings** available in this stage and the opportunity for winning teams to compete for more prize money in subsequent stages, innovative teams do not want to miss out. For more information about the competition and how to participate, [**visit the Challenge.gov page**](https://www.challenge.gov/?challenge=us-dot-intersection-safety-challenge&tab=resources).

In response to growing concerns regarding the safety of vulnerable road users at intersections and as part of the recent [**National Roadway Safety Strategy Call to Action**](https://www.transportation.gov/NRSS/CallToAction), the U.S. Department of Transportation has launched the [**Intersection Safety Challenge**](https://www.its.dot.gov/isc/index.html), which aims to transform intersection safety through the innovative application of emerging technologies to identify and mitigate unsafe conditions involving vehicles and vulnerable road users. Leveraging these technologies—such as machine vision, machine perception, sensor fusion, real-time decision-making, artificial intelligence, and vehicle-to-everything communications—could augment traditional safety engineering in roadway design and intersection control by anticipating, preventing, and mitigating unsafe roadway conditions.

The Intersection Safety Challenge includes a multi-stage Prize Competition to encourage teams of innovators and end-users to develop and test their intersection safety systems (ISS) to compete for up to $6 million total in prizes. In the first stage of the prize competition (i.e., Stage 1A), participants submit a Concept Paper describing their ISS concept and its potential to address the vision and objectives of the Challenge.
