The U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) has posted summary documents from the Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) Communications Summit held in August 2022 on the **[ITS/V2X Communications Website](https://www.its.dot.gov/research_areas/emerging_tech/htm/ITS_V2X_CommunicationSummit.htm)**. These documents include a short summary synopsis of key highlights and recommendations from the two-day event; and a more detailed summary that provides insight into the various panel and breakout discussions and action items that resulted from the summit.

Since the summit’s conclusion, the U.S. DOT has been conducting activities emphasized by industry and public sector stakeholders as critical path items for future connected, interoperable V2X deployments. These critical path items include:

-   Working to facilitate an improved level of Federal coordination between the U.S. DOT and Federal Agency partners by meeting with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)
-   Addressing issues associated with the pending Long-Term Evolution Cellular V2X (LTE-C-V2X) Waiver Requests and proposed parameters of the operational and technical service rules during the waiver period (as part of this work, U.S. DOT has also communicated with several of the waiver petitioners)
-   Finalizing the testing on unlicensed national information infrastructure (U-NII) in-vehicle interference
-   Advancing ideas for V2X Summit 2.0 and increased stakeholder collaboration
-   Initiating plans for developing a unified vision and comprehensive national plan for connected interoperable transportation environments as a means of moving V2X deployment forward.

The Department envisions a Nationwide Interoperable Connected Transportation System that improves safety and the environment, reduces congestion, and is equitable. We look forward to working with public agencies and industry to determine a strategy and timeline for achieving this vision.

This fall, the Department issued the Advanced Transportation Technology and Innovation (ATTAIN) and Strengthening Mobility and Revolutionizing Transportation (SMART) Grants, with V2X technologies as eligible activities. Proposals have been received and evaluations are underway.
