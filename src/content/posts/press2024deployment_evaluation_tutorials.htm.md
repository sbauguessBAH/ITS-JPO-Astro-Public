The new video tutorials offer a step-by-step guide to effectively navigate the ITS Benefits, Costs, and Lessons Learned database, the Deployment Tracking Survey Data Repository, and the many briefings and case studies the Program has developed.  
The currently available video tutorials include:

-   Benefits Tutorial

More video tutorials will be developed soon that will address additional how-to topics - stay tuned!  
In addition, the Program has also developed a short informational [**video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0311tUyZLo) that provides a quick overview of all the online resources the Program has available on its website.   

The ITS Deployment Evaluation website provides data on ITS benefits, costs and lessons learned on the safety, mobility, and environmental impacts over 25 years of ITS deployment. The website also contains data on the extent of ITS deployment from surveys of state and local agencies over the last 20 years, and offers briefings, case studies, data visualizations, and resources to support decision making for ITS investments.
