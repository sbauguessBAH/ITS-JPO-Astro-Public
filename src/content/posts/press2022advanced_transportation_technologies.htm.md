The U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) will host an informational webinar on the Advanced Transportation Technologies and Innovation (ATTAIN) Program on Wednesday, October 12 from 1:00 pm to 2:30 pm EDT.  

**Overview:** This webinar will provide information and accept questions regarding the Advanced Transportation Technologies and Innovative Mobility Deployment (ATTIMD) program established by the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) that renamed and restructured the Advanced Transportation and Congestion Management Technologies Deployment (ATCMTD) Program in 23 U.S.C. 503(c)(4). The ATTIMD Program is also known as ATTAIN. The currently available Notice of Funding Opportunity is the first annual solicitation for the ATTAIN program seeking applications from eligible entities to develop model deployment sites for large scale installation and operation of advanced transportation technologies to improve safety, efficiency, system performance, and infrastructure return on investment. The U.S. DOT intends for these model technology deployments to help demonstrate how emerging transportation technologies, data, and their applications can be effectively deployed and integrated with existing systems to provide access to essential services and other destinations.

**Agenda:** David Harris and Jim Garling, ATTAIN Program Managers, Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), will describe the program and the intention of legislation. David and Jim will also share U.S. DOT’s vision, interests, and goals as they relate to the ATTAIN program. Ryan Buck, Agreement/Contracting Officer, FHWA, and David will provide detailed information about the award as well as explain the application process for the ATTAIN program.

**Target Audience:** State or local governments, transit agencies, metropolitan planning or other political subdivisions of a State or local government (such as publicly-owned toll or port authorities), or a multijurisdictional group or consortia of research institutions or academic institutions.

**Learning Objectives:** Attendees are expected to learn about the background information for ATTAIN. They will also learn about the eligibility requirements and how to apply for the grant.
