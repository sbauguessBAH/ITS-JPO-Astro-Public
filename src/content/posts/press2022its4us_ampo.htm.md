The ITS4US Deployment Program sites will be sharing their plans on how they are using technology to enhance transportation options for all travelers in their communities at the **[2022 Association of Metropolitan Planning Organizations (AMPO) Annual Conference](https://ampo.org/news-events/ampo-annual-conference/)** in Minneapolis, Minnesota, from October 25 to 28, 2022. Attendees will have the opportunity to meet the ITS4US Deployment Program site teams at an AMPO Annual Conference session and learn how their deployments are designed to be replicated in your own community.

The ITS4US Deployment Program is a U.S. Department of Transportation multimodal effort that identifies ways to provide more efficient, affordable, and accessible transportation options for underserved communities that often face greater challenges in accessing essential services. ITS4US aims to solve mobility challenges for all travelers with a specific focus on underserved communities, including people with disabilities, older adults, low-income individuals, rural residents, veterans, and limited English proficiency travelers. This Program will enable communities to build local partnerships and develop and deploy integrated and replicable mobility solutions to achieve complete trips for all travelers.
