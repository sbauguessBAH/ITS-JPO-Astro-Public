Be sure to join the U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) during the Joint Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) International and Mid-Colonial District Annual Meeting and Exhibition and the 2024 National Rural Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Conference in Philadelphia for the July 21 workshop.

"Dealing with All the Front-End Stuff: How to Jump Start ITS Projects for Small and Rural Communities” will cover critical topics in the ITS deployment lifecycle, including planning, design, operations, and maintenance specifically focused on rural applications, as well as federal funding opportunities and deployment strategies.

This workshop features a combination of best practices presentations from subject matter experts, success stories, and lessons learned from on–the–ground rural ITS deployments.

Participants will engage in interactive activities and share opportunities and best practices for estimating benefits and outcomes and overcoming challenges such as staffing limitations and required coordination.

Attendees will benefit from Q&A time, peer networking and take-home resources to bring back to their agencies and apply to their work. In turn, U.S. DOT will gather feedback to incorporate into future initiatives and follow-up.
