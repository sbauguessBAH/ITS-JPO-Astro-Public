### New Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

Check out the [**FAQ page**](https://www.transportation.gov/grants/smart/smart-frequently-asked-questions) on the grant website for updated questions, including FAQs about the amendment to the SMART NOFO. The following are example updates to the FAQ web page including questions asked during the September webinar.

**Q: Can Stage 1 funding be used to expand a project that is already in progress?**

**A:** With Stage 1 Planning and Prototyping Grants, eligible applicants should focus on building out a proof-of-concept, partnerships, and capacity. It is possible that funding could be used to expand a project that is already in progress, if the applicant defines and illustrates how their project is a prototype. You can refer to our [**fact sheet**](https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2022-07/SMART%20Program%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf), which broadly defines demonstration activities, Stage 1 activities, and eligible projects. However, please note that costs that have been incurred on a project before it receives a SMART grant will not eligible costs for the SMART grant and therefore cannot be reimbursed.

**Q: Can a SMART grant be used for staff salaries?**

**A:** Staff costs may potentially be an eligible planning cost if essential to the purpose of the grant and consistent with the cost principles in 2 CFR Part 200 Subpart E. Please note that a staff member’s salary is only eligible in direct proportion of the work hours they spend on the project. For example, if the staff member spends 50 percent of their work hours on a SMART grant project, then 50 percent of their salary could be considered an eligible expense and reimbursed with SMART funding.

Questions about the SMART Grants Program that aren’t yet addressed in the FAQs can be sent via email to [**SMART@dot.gov**](mailto:SMART@dot.gov). **The deadline to submit technical questions is Friday, November 4, 2022.**
