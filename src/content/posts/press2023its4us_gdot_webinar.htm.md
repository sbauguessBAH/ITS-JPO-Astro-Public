title: "ITS4US Deployment Program Phase 2 Webinar: Georgia – Mobility and Accessibility Planner – The Ins and Outs of Building on Open Source Software"
date: 2023-07-07
---

Presented by Georgia Department of Transportation – Safe Trips in a Connected Transportation Network.

This webinar will focus on the Georgia **–** Mobility and Accessibility Planner (G-MAP) trip planner that is currently under development for the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) ITS4US Deployment project. 

G-MAP seeks to enhance the travel experience for underserved communities, including people with disabilities, older adults, and travelers with limited English proficiency. It will leverage innovative solutions and existing systems such as connected vehicle deployments, an advanced trip routing engine, and a regional trip planner—all to be developed within an open-source application. The application will allow travelers to create a personalized trip plan to navigate physical infrastructure, resolve unexpected obstacles, and increase visibility throughout their travel.

G-MAP is enhancing the Open Source Software (OSS) OpenTripPlanner (OTP) core functionality and the OSS extensions developed by Arcadis | IBI Group to build in features that support underserved communities including people with disabilities, older adults, and people with limited English proficiency. The webinar will discuss the following topics:

-   Characteristics and benefits of OSS
-   OTP and its features and governance
-   OSS Trip Planner modules
-   OTP Trip Planner Current Deployments – ATL RIDES
-   G-MAP features and enhancements included in the GDOT ITS4US Deployment Project  

**Date:** August 30, 2023  
**Time:** 2:00 to 3:30 pm ET  
**Presenters:** Norah Ocel, Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office (ITS JPO)/Federal Highway Administration; Jon Campbell and Jon Darton, Arcadis | IBI Group, Abby Marinelli, ATL

**ITS4US Program Overview**

The ITS4US Deployment Program, led by the ITS JPO at the U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT), expands access to transportation for all travelers with a specific focus on underserved communities, including people with disabilities, older adults, veterans, individuals of low income, people in rural communities, and those with limited English proficiency. This program embodies the Administration’s priorities of transportation equity, economic growth, sustainability, and most importantly, compassion and inclusivity. The program funds multiple large-scale replicable deployments in three phases:

-   Phase 1: concept development
-   Phase 2: design and testing
-   Phase 3: operations and evaluation

In June 2022, the deployment sites completed the concept development phase of each of their projects. The U.S. DOT awarded four teams with Phase 2 funding to support the design and testing of their projects based on their Phase 1 concepts. The four deployment sites are:

-   GDOT
-   Heart of Iowa Regional Transit Agency
-   Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority/Buffalo
-   University of Washington

For more details on the ITS4US Deployment program, see the program’s website at: [**https://its.dot.gov/its4us/**](https://www.its.dot.gov/its4us/index.htm).

ITS JPO is hosting a series of free, public webinars to allow each of the four Phase 2 deployment sites to publicly share topics and experiences that would be of interest to deployers considering innovative technology solutions to solve mobility challenges of underserved communities. These webinars will be an opportunity for each site to discuss their experiences during the Design/Build Test/Phase and engage the broader ITS4US Deployment Program Community about their efforts so far in Phase 2. At the end of the presentation, there will be an opportunity for the audience to ask the site questions about their project. Future deployers can benefit from lessons learned and experiences from the ITS4US deployment teams.
