### Background

In early 2021, the U.S. Department of Transportation launched the Complete Trip – ITS4US Deployment Program. The program aims to solve mobility challenges for all travelers—regardless of location, income, or disability—and assists with accessing jobs, education, healthcare, and other activities. To date, the program has awarded $40 million to five sites to participate in Phase 1 of the program to plan and conceptualize their large-scale, real-world deployments of integrated innovative technologies to address the challenges of planning and executing complete trips.
