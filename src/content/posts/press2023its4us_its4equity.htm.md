The ITS4US Deployment Program is a U.S. DOT multimodal effort that identifies ways to provide more efficient, affordable, and accessible transportation options for underserved communities that often face greater challenges in accessing essential services. ITS4US aims to solve mobility challenges for all travelers with a specific focus on underserved communities, including people with disabilities, older adults, low-income individuals, rural residents, veterans, and limited English proficiency travelers. This Program will enable communities to build local partnerships and develop and deploy integrated and replicable mobility solutions to achieve complete trips for all travelers.
