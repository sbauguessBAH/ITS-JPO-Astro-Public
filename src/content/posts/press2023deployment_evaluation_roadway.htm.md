The U.S. Department of Transportation's (U.S. DOT) top priority is safety. The U.S. DOT **[National Roadway Safety Strategy](https://www.transportation.gov/NRSS)** outlines the Safe System Approach as the guiding paradigm to reduce serious injuries and deaths on our Nation’s highways, roads, and streets. Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) can support these objectives and help in reaching the goal of zero roadway fatalities.

The ITS Joint Program Office’s ITS Deployment Evaluation Program has developed the **[Spotlight on ITS for Roadway Safety](https://www.itskrs.its.dot.gov/safety)** web pages, containing a variety of evaluation products organized by safety category to support informed decision-making. Current topics include pedestrian safety, work zone safety, and roadway safety, with more topics on the way. We invite you to explore the safety topics to learn more about how ITS has been proven to improve safety.
