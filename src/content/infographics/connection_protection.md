Gives passengers real-time transit information to more accurately predict whether they will make their next connection. A passenger can use their personal mobile device to initiate a request for a connection to wait. If multiple people on a delayed transit vehicle will miss their next connection, transportation providers can adjust departures to enable the passengers to make their next connection
