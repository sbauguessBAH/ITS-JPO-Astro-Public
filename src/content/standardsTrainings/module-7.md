This module provides guidance on how to identify user needs if they do not already exist and distinguish user needs from requirements when they are mixed in non-SEP environments. This module assists participants in writing user needs by studying examples from SEP-based standards. This module is recommended to be taken in conjunction with A203 Writing Requirements When ITS Standards Do Not Have SEP Content.
