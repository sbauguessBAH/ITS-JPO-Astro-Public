module: 11
code: A313a
title: "Understanding User Needs for ESS Systems Based on NTCIP 1204 v04 Standard"
length: "1 hour, 8 minutes"
---
The purpose of this **updated module** is to incorporate necessary changes such as new ESS user needs/requirements and ESS test procedures provided in recently completed work on NTCIP 1204 Standard v04 and reorganized documentation from the previous v03. The module provides participants with information on how to identify the appropriate use of the NTCIP 1204 Standard v04 and acquire an ESS system based on what the user is seeking to accomplish; and provides participants with information on how to identify user needs that can then be traced to the requirements, which will be discussed in A313b: Specifying Requirements for ESS based on NTCIP 1204 Standard v04, with support from tools and resources such as Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) and Protocol Requirements List (PRL) in following a Systems Engineering (SE) Process. An updated final module, T313, will deal with the preparation of testing documentation for ESS based on the NTCIP 1204 Standard v04.

This module helps the user understand the scope of the ESS Standard v04 and its previous versions, and incorporates current field practices. It also assists in identifying the uses and associated needs of ESS-based systems. PRL is a major focus in this module as it lays out a foundation by providing user needs and their requirements.
