The Advanced Transportation Controller (ATC) family of standards provides an open architecture hardware and software platform that can support a wide variety of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) field applications including traffic management, safety, security, and other applications. These standards are characterized by their modularity, their support of multiple and current application programs, and they're designed to facilitate the adoption of new technologies. There are three standards within the ATC program: the ATC 5201 ATC Standard, the ATC 5401 Application Programming Interface (API) Standard, and the ATC 5301 ATC Cabinet Standard.

The focus of this module is on the recently approved ATC 5301 ATC Cabinet Standard v02. This module discusses the advantages of transportation field cabinet systems that conform to the standard. It presents the structure of the standard. It helps users identify and write user needs for ATC Cabinets which helps to justify and support their specification.
