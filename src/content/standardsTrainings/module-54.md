Signal System Master (SSM) is a traffic controller device used in the field as a supervising device and operates above intersection traffic controllers. As a Field Management Station (FMS), a Signal System Master (SSM) acts as a traffic controller device assigned to supervise several Signal System Locals (SSLs) located at intersections in close vicinity. The current NTCIP 1210 v01 SSM standard is systems engineering (SE) process-based and provides for the SSM needs and requirements and related design content.

There is a need to understand what to test, when to test, and why to test SSM so that users get what they have specified (a communications interface with field SSMs) and learn to prepare testing documentation needed for the agency's SSM procurement specification. Keeping this overall need in mind, this module aims to create SSM test documentation based on standardized formats (IEEE 829 2008) and relate the formats to key elements of NTCIP 1210 Standard v01. This will ensure central Traffic Management System (TMS) connectivity and data communication interface with the field SSMs within the reference architecture provided by the standard.

This module is based on the IEEE 829 2008 formats for testing documentation (NTCIP 1210 v01 standard does not offer testing documentation preparation information). The IEEE 829 2008 approach has already been amply covered by testing series modules. This module will help users leverage their NTCIP 1210 v01-based specifications to produce and apply a sample test plan, including test design specifications, test case specifications, and test procedure specifications for SSM. Thus, the development of clear and unambiguous NTCIP 1210 v01-based testing documentation can be used by system developers and integrators during procurement specifications preparation, system acceptance, and ongoing maintenance efforts. The module will guide agencies in verifying that delivered products conform to NTCIP standards and comply with the agency's specifications.
