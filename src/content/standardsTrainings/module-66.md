This module explains how a Security Credential Management System (SCMS) is a critical component of ensuring trust while maintaining privacy in a vehicle-to-everything (V2X) ecosystem. In contrast to other types of safety technologies currently found in the vehicle fleet, connected vehicle applications are cooperativeâ€”meaning, vehicles must exchange and analyze authenticated messages in real time to realize the benefits of the system. The correctness and reliability of messages being transmitted between devices is of critical importance as it impacts the outcomes and effectiveness of safety applications based on them. Devices sending messages need to digitally sign their messages and the receiving devices need to verify the signature before acting on it. To protect the privacy of vehicle owners, the certificates used to sign the messages contain no personal or equipment-identifying information but serve as system credentials so that other users in the system can trust the source of each message. The SCMS also plays a key function in protecting the content of each message by identifying and removing misbehaving devices, while still maintaining privacy.

After taking this course, participants will be able to understand the application of a transportation-oriented SCMS and how the security certificates provide the mechanism for devices to exchange messages in a trustworthy and privacy-protected manner. This course will help participants to understand the standards used to ensure the security of the V2X communications exchanges, including the interoperability among devices operating in a connected vehicle environment. Finally, participants will understand technical and organizational challenges associated with obtaining credentials for use by devices that participate in deployments and will be positioned to specify implementation or deployment requirements related to SCMS-based certificate management.
