The purpose of this module is to teach the students how to identify and write user needs specific to the NTCIP 1205 v01 CCTV Standard, which does not currently contain user needs.

The focus of this module is to assist technical staff in developing a set of user needs that meet operational needs to support traffic management and traveler information service functions. This module helps the user understand the scope of the CCTV Standard. It also assists in identifying the uses and associated operational needs of CCTV systems.

This module builds on A203: Writing Requirements When ITS Standards Do Not Have SE Content module process and techniques and provide participants with information on how to identify the appropriate use of the NTCIP 1205 v01 Standard and acquire a CCTV system based on what the user is seeking to accomplish with support from tools and resources such as an MIB and conformance groups and statement, in following a Systems Engineering Process (SEP).
