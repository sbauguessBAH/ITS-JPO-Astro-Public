This module provides an introduction to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) reference architectures and how the Architecture Reference for Cooperative and Intelligent Transportation (ARC-IT), the Harmonized Architecture Reference for Technical Standards (HARTS), and associated tools can be used to manage the risks associated with deploying ITS. By taking this module, participants will learn about the useful resources available for planning their ITS deployments and guiding them through the pitfalls related to their specific project.

The module starts with an introduction to architectures in general and explains differences among project, planning (a.k.a. regional), and reference architectures. It then discusses ITS reference architectures in more detail, explaining their purpose and format. It then explains how HARTS was a snapshot effort intended to demonstrate specific concepts, and how the enhanced communications view developed by this effort will be maintained (e.g., as a part of the ARC-IT project). Finally, the course explains how this enhanced communications view can be used by ITS deployment projects to become aware of key issues with standards and how to get involved in addressing them.
