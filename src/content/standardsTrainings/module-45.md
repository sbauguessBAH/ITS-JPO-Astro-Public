The purpose of this module is to teach students how to identify and develop well-formed requirements specific to the NTCIP 1207 v02 RMC Standard, which does not currently contain requirements, and points out where RMC are currently in operation (e.g.: CA, AZ, NY, MN, etc.). Building on the user needs identified in A309a module, this module deals with the subject of requirements—the next step of the systems life cycle—that will develop well-formed requirements specific to the RMC Standard, independent of the type of traffic controllers (ASC, ATC, 2070 or 170).
