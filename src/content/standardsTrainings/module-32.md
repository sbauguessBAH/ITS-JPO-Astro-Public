module: 32
code: "A315b, Part 1 of 2"
title: "Specifying Requirements for Actuated Traffic Signal Controllers (ASC) Based on NTCIP 1202 v03 Standard (Updated 2021)"
length: "1 hour, 25 minutes"
---
NTCIP 1202 v03, Object Definitions for Actuated Signal Controllers (ASC), was recently updated and published. This standard defines objects to allow transportation professionals to monitor, configure, and control traffic signal controllers. Version 3 of the standard was developed using a Systems Engineering Process (SEP) and contains user needs, requirements, and design content. The SEP allows transportation managers and specification writers to more easily prepare a Procurement Requirements List (PRL) for ASC procurement specifications.

This module is part of the SEP path; thus students must learn how to specify requirements based on well-written user needs specific to the ASC Standard, which is addressed in A315a: Understanding User Needs for Actuated Traffic Signal Controllers (ASC) Based on NTCIP 1202 Standard. This module addresses the next step of the systems life cycle, which is to select appropriate requirements from the PRL contained in the NTCIP 1202 v03 Standard and to only supplement these with new well-formed requirements when justified. The module is provided in two parts, Part 1 and Part 2.

Part 1 focuses on specifying ASC requirements and introduces the design content (dialogs, objects and other references, and/or special project requirements, if any) using tools and resources in the Standard such as the Protocol Requirements List (PRL), the Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM), the Management Information Base (MIB) and the SEP. Part 1 provides participants with information on how to understand the scope of the NTCIP 1202 v03 Standard, identifies the appropriate use of the Standard to acquire an Actuated Traffic Signal Controller or ASC system and how to prepare (tailor) their ASC project specification based on the information provided by the Standard, such as building a project level RTM in addition to the project level PRL introduced in Module 315a. The module also stresses that agencies require a project level PRL, which must be included in the ASC specification.
