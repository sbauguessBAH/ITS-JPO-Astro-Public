IEEE 1609 family of standards for Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE) supports the DSRC communication technology deployed in conjunction with 5.9 GHz spectrum in a Connected Vehicle (CV) environment. These WAVE standards provide the basis for the design of CV safety and mobility applications and provide network services so that applications can be seamless without regard to specific manufacturers, including data storage access mechanisms, device management, and secure message passing.
The intent of this module is to introduce technical details of the IEEE 1609 family of standards which defines the architecture, communications model, management structure, security mechanisms, and physical access mechanism. The scope includes discussion on the functionality of the WAVE standards as they are used in conjunction with the 5.9 GHz spectrum-based DSRC radio operation and illustrate WAVE protocol stack to show how IEEE 1609 family of standards and other cooperative standards (SAE J2735) fit together:

* IEEE 1609.0 (Guide)
* The security protocols defined in IEEE 1609.2
* The network-layer protocol defined in IEEE 1609.3 (WSMP), and IPv6 processing for non-critical (supplementary) ITS information
* Provide extensions to the physical channel access defined in IEEE 802.11 to support the WAVE standards in IEEE 1609.4 (Multi-channel operation)

Network engineers, hardware engineers, and application designers supporting CV environment will gain further insight into WAVE standards as they cooperatively define the communications architecture for DSRC-based V2V and V2I interactions, and as the basis for the low-latency interface design of WAVE devices (OBU-ASD-RSU).
