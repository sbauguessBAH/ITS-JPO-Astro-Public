module: 17
code: T311
title: "Applying Your Test Plan to the NTCIP 1203 v03 DMS Standard"
length: "1 hour, 18 minutes"
---
This **updated module** assists user agencies in creating a test plan specific to their dynamic message system needs based on the NTCIP 1203 v03 standard. NTCIP 1202 v03 builds on the NTCIP 1202 v02 standard by adding test procedures for testing conformance to the standard. Prior to developing such a test plan, the user is expected to be knowledgeable of the NTCIP 1203 v03 standard and testing methodologies. This module will cover material related to elements of the 1203 standard required to apply test plans to verify that an agencyâ€™s product or system meets design specifications and other requirements of the NTCIP 1203 DMS standard, while following standard testing methodologies.

This module includes a brief description of the DMS standard with examples in order to perform the verification mentioned above. This module covers the role of other modes of testing including compliance, manufacturing and acceptance tests, and verification and validation as part of the testing life cycle.

This module uses a sample test plan for NTCIP 1203 DMS to demonstrate the proper way to create a test plan specific to the user needs and requirements based on the DMS standard, including test procedures. It walks participants through the process of correctly creating a test plan. This module also explains the types of testing applied within the acquisition process.
