This module provides an introduction to the connected vehicle environment and a description of the potential benefits and capabilities of a Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) environment. The module presents several V2I safety, mobility, and environmental applications and discusses the types of information that may be exchanged between the different devices that make up the V2I environment.

The module then presents the ITS Standards that help support the deployment of a V2I application and a V2I infrastructure. The module also introduces some of the challenges to designing and implementing a V2I infrastructure, and provides some strategies and approaches to deploying the V2I infrastructure.
