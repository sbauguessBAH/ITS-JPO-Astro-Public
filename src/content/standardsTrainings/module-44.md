Modules A207a and A207b provided details of ATC 5201 Standard v06 and suggested a procurement specification outline. This module focuses on how such a procurement specification may be developed, emphasizing the development and formalization of requirements based on user needs. This module reviews features of ATC units, offers new approaches for developing a procurement specification, discusses the components of an ATC procurement specification, and helps users develop and write requirements.
