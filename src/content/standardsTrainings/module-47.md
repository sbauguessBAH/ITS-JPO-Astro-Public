The purpose of this module is to teach the student how to develop a Test Procedure Specification (TPS) and how said document fits into the testing process and relates to the Test Plan, Test Design Specification, and Test Case Specification. In addition, the student will be taught how to develop the TPS to meet the specific project requirements for the interface (as found in the Protocol Requirements List (PRL)) or Needs to Requirements Traceability Matrix (NRTM).

### Learning Objectives/Key Elements
1. Recognize the purpose and structure of a test procedure
2. Identify the role of Test Procedure Specification (TPS) within a test plan and the overall testing process
3. Synchronize the test procedure specification to the contract terms and conditions for successful contract execution.
4. Write the reports produced at the end of testing and understand their relationship to successful procurement contracts
5. Use tools to develop the test procedures for a sample TPS structure
