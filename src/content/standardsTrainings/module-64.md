The Introduction to Cybersecurity for Transportation Agencies module provides an overview of key topics relating to cybersecurity for transportation agencies. This module first discusses the need for cybersecurity, including typical threats that transportation agencies face to their centers, field equipment, and communications. Next, the module introduces the NIST Cybersecurity Framework which enables organizations to apply the principles and best practices of risk management to improving security and resilience. The module then discusses how to apply the Framework to a transportation agency. Finally, the module looks at resources that are available to agencies for sharing information about cybersecurity threats and incidents. Additional resources on cybersecurity for the roadway transportation infrastructure are identified.
