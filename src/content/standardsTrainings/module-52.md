An electric and lighting management system (ELMS) is defined as any system that is able to automatically control and manage roadside electrical and lighting devices using the National Transportation Communications for Intelligent Transportation System Protocol (NTCIP). In general, an ELMS is composed of a set of field devices (luminaires, electric circuits, electric vehicle chargers, connected vehicle, smart grid connectivity, etc.) that are controlled by one or more management stations (computing platforms).

This module assists user agencies in creating and applying a test plan specific to their electrical and lighting management system needs based on the NTCIP 1213 v03 Standard. Prior to developing such a test plan, the user is expected to be knowledgeable of the NTCIP 1213 v03 Standard and testing methodologies. This module will cover material related to elements of the NTCIP 1213 v03 standard required to apply test plans to verify that an agencyâ€™s product or system meets design specifications and other conformance requirements of the NTCIP 1213 Standard v03, while following standard testing methodologies, including test procedures. (NTCIP 1203 v03 does not contain test procedures).

This module includes a brief description of the ELMS standard with examples on how to perform the verification mentioned above. This module covers the role of other modes of testing including compliance, manufacturing and acceptance tests, and verification and validation as part of the testing life cycle.
