Transportation Sensor Systems (TSS) is defined as any system capable of sensing and communicating near real-time traffic parameters using the National Transportation Communications for ITS Protocol (NTCIP). Transportation system managers use TSS in a variety of ways to improve transportation system operations. To facilitate efficient movement within a transportation system, system operators need timely and accurate information on traffic flow within the system. This is typically accomplished by measuring traffic parameters at desired locations within the transportation system.

This module provides participants with information on how to identify and use the NTCIP 1209 v2 Standard appropriately and acquire a TSS system based on what the user is seeking to accomplish with support from tools and resources such as a Protocol Requirements List (PRL) in following a Systems Engineering Process (SE). This module helps the user understand the scope of the TSS Standard and the ConOps it supports. It also assists in identifying the user needs of TSS systems.

This module is to be placed in the context of the SE as well as in the acquisition curriculum path with A312B: Specifying Requirements for Transportation Sensor Systems (TSS) Based on NTCIP 1209 Standard following this module.
