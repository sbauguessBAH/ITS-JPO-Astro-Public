An environmental sensor station (ESS) consists of a remote micro-processor coupled with any number of sensors that monitor the surrounding environment, which may include weather, pavement, water levels, and/or air quality conditions. An ESS may also be used to control related equipment, such as pavement treatment systems and/or cameras.

The focus of this **updated module** is to assist user agencies in creating test documentation specific to their ESS needs based on the NTCIP 1204 Standard v04. The test documentation includes a test plan and test design specification that links to the standardized test cases and test procedures which are available in NTCIP 1204 v04 documentation and explain how this testing documentation traces back to the requirements and design elements of the standard. This module also provides examples of how to perform tests. Prior to taking this course, the student is expected to be knowledgeable of the NTCIP 1204 standard v04 and testing methodologies.
