module: 10
code: A311a
title: "Understanding User Needs for DMS Systems Based on NTCIP 1203 Standard v03"
length: "1 hour, 30 minutes"
---
The purpose of this **updated module** is to incorporate necessary changes made by the updated NTCIP standard v03 (from v02), and assist technical staff in writing unambiguous, complete, and well-written user needs based on NTCIP 1213 Standard v03. This module provides participants with information on how to identify the appropriate use of the NTCIP 1213 Standard v03 and acquire a DMS system based on what the user is seeking to accomplish.

The module content will include several real-world operational scenarios that use DMS messages to illustrate commonly needed user needs. The module discussion will include key operational needs and how such user needs are handled in a regional context with sharing DMSs and capability. This updated module will help the user understand the scope of the latest DMS standard and current operational practices. The module focuses on the communications interface aspectsâ€”how to configure, monitor, and control DMSs remotely from a Transportation Management Center (TMC) Management Station or locally at the front-panel of a DMS controller, using data objects provided by the NTCIP 1203 v03 standard Management Information Base (MIB).
