This module explains how the NTCIP Framework offers design solutions through use of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and the Simple Transportation Management Protocol (STMP) to fulfill operational needs, control and commands, and monitoring of range of field devices in ITS operations. This module introduces basic concepts of the International Organization of Standards (ISO) seven layers Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model (OSI-RM), and mapping to the five levels of the NTCIP Framework, which contain protocols for center-to-field (C2F) and center-to-center (C2C) communication. This module explains the application of these protocols in deploying field devices such as DMS, CCTV, and ASC without going into details on protocols constructs. The transportation field is also constrained with issues such as bandwidth, latency, and errors, which are concerns in transportation field deployments and are introduced in this module. This module also introduces the concepts of interoperability and interchangeability with NTCIP. Students are also introduced to standards such as NTCIP 1203 and 1103 to better understand STMP. Examples of field deployments using both SE and non-SE standards are presented.

Upon taking this course, a student should be able to understand how the remote management of ITS field devices from a central management station works at a very high level and how various devices can share the same system environment and be compatible. This will help students in understanding device standards used in ITS applications and the testing phase of system acceptance.
