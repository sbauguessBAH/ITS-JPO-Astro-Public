The Center-to-Center-(C2C) Reference Implementation (RI) is a tool developed under contract to the U.S. DOT that mimics an operational traffic management system that provides a traffic management data dictionary (TMDD) conformant interface to external systems. It supports all features defined in the TMDD v3.03 standard and serves as a useful development and testing tool to verify that new software is able to interoperate with a known reference.

The purpose of this module is to train users on the importance of the Center-to-Center Reference Implementation to verify that C2C interfaces conform to the protocol standard (NTCIP 2306 v1.69) and TMDD v3.03c standards and are compliant to Section 1201 of SAFETEA-LU (the Data Exchange Format Specifications does not specify communication protocols; it does refer to existing standardized protocols that can be used for transferring the data). This Module teaches students why the C2C RI is important, how it makes testing easier, and how it reduces cost. In addition, the module teaches the student C2C RI features and give examples on how the C2C RI is used for the various types of features.

This module also explains how students can obtain a copy of the C2C RI. The focus of this module is to introduce personnel to the Center-to-Center (C2C) Reference Implementation (RI) so that they are aware of its existence, purpose, capabilities, and value to deployment projects; it will also alert participants to the limitations of the software and the resources required for its proper use. The module explains how the tool can be used to verify that a deployed system conforms to the standardized exchanges.

Participants that plan on being hands-on users of the C2C RI are encouraged to follow this course with T351. Those in a more managerial role may choose to make this their final module in the series.
