The focus of this module is on the ATC Standard. The module details the ATC Standard's features and capabilities, it discusses how the ATC Standard works with other ITS standards, and it provides deployment considerations and migration strategies for users. This module also provides a general understanding of how field cabinet systems work as context for the ATC Standard.

Some of the questions answered for users:
* When should the standard apply?
* What should I do if my current infrastructure is old equipment?
* How does this impact my current operation?
* How does this effect training and maintenance?
* Will my current software work on these new devices?
* What opportunities will it provide me going forward?
* How does the standard support interchangeability?
