This course provides participants with an understanding of the need for a test plan when developing/deploying systems based on ITS standards within the context of an overall systems testing process/life cycle. This module identifies key elements of a test plan and its relevance in the context of the overall testing process/life cycle using IEEE 829 and FHWA VEE diagrams as reference with one or more examples of well-written test plans in a standard format.
