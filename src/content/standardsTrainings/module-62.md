Connected vehicles (CV), a component of the Cooperative Intelligent Transportation System (C-ITS) environment, have the potential to significantly reduce vehicular crashes, provide operators of surface transportation systems with more timely and accurate system performance data to better manage their systems, and provide travelers with access to specific traveler information. To achieve these benefits, it is essential that agencies use standards in deploying connected vehicle technologies to maximize the benefits from the connected vehicle environment. Proper deployment of standards will support interoperability, minimize future integration costs, make procurements easier, and facilitate regional and national integration.

The purpose of this module is to introduce transportation managers and specification writers to the purpose and contents of the SPaT and MAP messages, which are key messages exchanged between CV applications related to signalized intersections. The module will focus on two aspects for using the messagesâ€”what information can be provided by each standardized message, and implementation considerations related to each message. The implementation considerations will discuss what information needs to be provided to satisfy an operational need of the agency, security considerations, existing tools to support implementation and efforts to standardized how to implement these two messages to facilitate interoperability and regional and national integration.
