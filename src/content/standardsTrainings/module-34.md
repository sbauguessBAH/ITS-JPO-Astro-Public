The purpose of this module is to teach students how to develop well-formed requirements specific to the NTCIP 1205 v01 CCTV Standard.

This module will provide participants with information on how to write well-formed requirements using the NTCIP 1205 v01 Standard for procuring a CCTV system based on what the user is seeking to accomplish even when the standard does not have requirements. This is achieved with support from resources such as a Management Information Base (MIB), conformance groups, and by following a Systems Engineering Process (SEP) used in other standards.
