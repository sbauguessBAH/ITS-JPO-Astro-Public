code: "T307"
title: "Applying Your Test Plan to the Advanced Traffic Controller Based on ATC 5201 Standard v06"
length: "1 hour, 45 minutes"

The Advanced Transportation Controller (ATC) family of standards provides an open architecture hardware and software platform that can support a wide variety of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) field applications. These standards are characterized by their modularity, support of multiple and concurrent application programs, and design to facilitate the adoption of new technologies.

This module is based on the IEEE 829-2008 formats for testing documentation. Note that the ATC 5201 v06 Standard includes an Environmental and Test Procedures section, but does not offer testing documentation preparation information. The IEEE 829-2008 approach has already been amply covered by testing series modules. This module will help users leverage their ATC 5201-based specifications to produce and apply a sample test plan, including test design specifications, test case specifications, and test procedure specifications for ATC. Thus, the development of clear and unambiguous ATC 5201 v06-based testing documentation can be used by system developers and integrators during procurement specifications preparation, system acceptance, and ongoing maintenance efforts. The module will guide agencies in verifying that delivered products conform to ATC 5201 standards and comply with the agency's specifications.

You will learn what to test, when to test, and why to test an ATC so that users get what they have specified (a computer platform with interfaces to appropriate cabinet wiring) and learn to prepare testing documentation needed for the agency's ATC procurement specification. Keeping this overall need in mind, the module aims to create ATC test documentation based on standardized formats (IEEE 829-2008) and relating the formats to key elements of ATC 5201 Standard v06. This will ensure central TMS connectivity and data communication interface with the field ATCs, as well as appropriate configuration of optional elements to interface with cabinet wiring.
