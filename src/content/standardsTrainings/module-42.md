NTCIP 1202 v03, Object Definitions for Actuated Signal Controllers (ASC), was recently updated and published. This standard defines objects to allow transportation professionals to monitor, configure, and control traffic signal controllers. Version 3 of the standard was developed using a Systems Engineering Process (SEP) and contains user needs, requirements, and design content. The SEP allows transportation managers and specification writers to more easily prepare a Procurement Requirements List (PRL) for ASC procurement specifications.

The module is provided in two parts, Part 1 and Part 2 and a continuation with the previous modules, A315a, A315b Part 1. Module A315a introduced the new content of the standard and explained how users could use the Protocol Requirements List (PRL) to select the requirements applicable to their project. Part 1 of this module (Module A315b Part 1) reviewed the scope of the standard and focused on mapping the requirements selected in the PRL to the corresponding design content using the Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM). Part 1 also described how the PRL and RTM are intended to be used within project specifications.

Part 2 extends these previous discussions by focusing on additional considerations when specifying NTCIP 1202 v03, and the unique aspects of the NTCIP 1202 device standard when compared to other NTCIP device standards. Part 2 also discusses how to define extensions for ASC systems to address user needs and requirements that are not supported by the NTCIP 1202 v03 standard. This module concludes by introducing the latest developments related to testing ASCs.
