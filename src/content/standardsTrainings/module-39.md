Modules A207a and A207b provided details of ATC 5201 Standard v06 and suggested a procurement specification outline. This module focuses on how such a procurement specification may be developed, emphasizing the identification and formalization of user needs. This module reviews features of ATC units, offers new approaches to developing a procurement specification, discusses the components of an ATC 5201-based procurement specification, and helps users identify and write user needs.
