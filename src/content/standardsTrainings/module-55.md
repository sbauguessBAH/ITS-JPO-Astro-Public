The Advanced Transportation Controller (ATC) family of standards provides an open architecture hardware and software platform that can support a wide variety of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) field applications. These standards are characterized by their modularity, support of multiple and concurrent application programs, and design to facilitate the adoption of new technologies.

The ATC 5401 Application Programming Interface (API) Standard v02 defines API Software that provides both user and programmatic interfaces for transportation controller units that conform to the ATC 5201 Transportation Controller Standard (ATC units). The API Software allows application programs to be written so that they may run on any ATC unit regardless of the manufacturer. It also allows multiple application programs to be compatible on a single ATC unit by sharing the fixed resources of the controller.

As part of the API Reference Implementation (APIRI) Project, the API Validation Suite (APIVS) software was developed that it may be used to test API Software resident on an ATC unit. The APIVS Software is maintained in an open source software (OSS) environment and is available to anyone. Test documentation based on IEEE 829-2008 that leverages that APIVS Software is also provided.

Module T308 focuses on testing the API Software based on the ATC 5401 Standard. At the conclusion of this module, participants will be able to: understand the purpose of the APIVS Software; use test documentation to specify API Software acceptance testing; use the APIVS Software to perform API Software testing; and interpret and report the results of testing.
