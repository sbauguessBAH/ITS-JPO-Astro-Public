This module assists user agencies in their efforts to create test plans specific to their RMC needs based on the NTCIP 1207 Standard v02. Prior to developing such a test plan, the user is expected to be knowledgeable of the NTCIP 1207 Standard v02 and testing methodologies. The agency is also expected to have developed their own user needs and requirements related to the NTCIP 1207 Standard (discussed in modules A309a and A309b).

This module will be based on the IEEE 829 formats for test documentation and will review sample test documentation that should result from performing the tests identified including test logs, test summary, and test incident reports. It will also guide agencies in verifying that delivered products comply with the agency's NTCIP specifications.
