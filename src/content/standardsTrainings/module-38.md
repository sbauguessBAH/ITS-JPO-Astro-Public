Connected vehicles have the potential to improve the safety, sustainability, efficiency, reliability, and comfort of transportation. Creating an environment that promotes this technology will result in significant benefits to transportation agencies and society as a whole. While most of the costs involved in realizing V2V communications are borne by vehicle owners, agency personnel should be aware of the capabilities of these vehicles and how they might enhance agency operations.

This module provides a high-level overview of vehicle-to-vehicle communications and its potential benefits to the operators of surface transportation systems. The module presents several V2V safety, mobility, and environmental applications, and discusses how these applications impact surface transportation operations while also identifying a handful of applications that have direct significance to transportation agencies. It also reviews the types of information that may be exchanged between the connected devices that make up the V2V environment.

This module then presents the intelligent transportation system (ITS) Standards that help support the deployment of the V2V environment and V2V applications. This module also introduces some of the challenges to implementing the V2V environment and how surface transportation systems can support the V2V environment.
