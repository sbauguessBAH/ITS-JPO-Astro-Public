The purpose of this module is to teach the student how to develop a Test Procedure Specification (TPS) and how said document fits into the testing process and relates to the Test Plan, Test Design Specification, and Test Case Specification. In addition, the student will be taught how to develop the TPS to meet the specific project requirements for the interface as found in the Protocol Requirements List (PRL) or Needs to Requirements Traceability Matrix (NRTM).

### Learning Objectives/Key Elements
6. Use the Test Plan Generator (TPG) to generate test procedures for a variety of equipment
   * NTCIP 8002 Annex B1
   * Role of TPG
   * TPG successful installation
   * Example test procedures for NTCIP 1203 v03 Dynamic Message Sign (DMS)
7. Adapt the generated test procedures to procurement contract terms and conditions for successful project conclusion
   * Discuss lessons learned from unsuccessful ITS projects and explain how to avoid repetition.
   * BEGIN by planning a test procedure to be used successfully at the END of the procurement
   * Demonstrate how to include clear, unambiguous contract terms and conditions
   * Demonstrate how to work backwards FROM the projectâ€™s successful end TO the beginning of the procurement process
8. Develop complex test procedures that pull together NTCIP elements using the TPG
   * Analyze a preexisting Central System from Vendor A
   * Plan for an upcoming procurement contract to add a variety of equipment
   * Specify, create, and test of MSOs for special needs
   * Use of TPG as acceptance test throughout the project
   * Explain how terms and conditions are based on the test procedure
   * Use TPG outputs as pass/fail criteria for project end and example of reports for project end
