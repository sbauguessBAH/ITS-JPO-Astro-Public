The purpose of this updated module is to incorporate necessary changes resulting from new user needs and capabilities such as connected vehicles, SMART Grid, and others included in the updated NTCIP 1213 standard v03 (from v02), and assist technical staff in specifying clear requirements from the list of requirements that exist in the NTCIP 1213 v03 Standard and meet identified user needs. This module will continue to provide participants with information on how to identify the appropriate use of the NTCIP 1213 Standard and acquire an ELMS system based on what the user is seeking to accomplish as identified by tracing the user needs to the requirements with support from tools and resources such as a Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) and Protocol Requirements List (PRL) in following a systems engineering process.
