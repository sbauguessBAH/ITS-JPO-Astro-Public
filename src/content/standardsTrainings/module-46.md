T203.2, Part 2 of 2, will instruct the student how to develop a test case specification for specific project requirements, how to develop a requirements to test case matrix, how to handle errors and failures, and explain relevant test reports (test logs, test incident reports, and test summary report).

Subsequent modules will define how to prepare test procedures and how to perform tests.
