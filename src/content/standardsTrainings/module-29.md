The Advanced Transportation Controller (ATC) family of standards provides an open architecture hardware and software platform that can support a wide variety of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) field applications including traffic management, safety, security, and other applications. These standards are characterized by their modularity, support of multiple and current application programs, and design to facilitate the adoption of new technologies.

The focus of this module is on the ATC 5201 Standard. The module details the ATC 5201 Standardâ€™s features and capabilities; it discusses how the ATC 5201 Standard works with other ITS standards; and it provides deployment considerations and migration strategies for users. This module is the continuation of A207a: Building an ITS Infrastructure Based on the ATC 5201 Standard Part 1 of 2.
