The focus of this **updated module** is to assist technical staff in specifying clear requirements from the list of requirements that exist in NTCIP 1204 v04 ESS and meeting identified user needs. This module continues to provide participants with information on how to identify the appropriate use of the NTCIP 1204 v04 standard and acquire an ESS system based on what the user is seeking to accomplish as identified by tracing the user needs to the requirements with support from tools and resources such as a RTM and PRL in following a systems engineering process. Focus is placed on RTM and how to prepare a project-level RTM for ESS specification. This module reviews the pros and cons of selecting requirements not covered by the standard and the need to avoid an orphaned user need or requirement for a system.

This module also helps the user understand the scope of the ESS standard and its versions in continuation with the previous module A313a. This module is placed in the context of the systems engineering process as well as in the acquisition curriculum path with I101, A101, A102, and A201 being the prerequisites. This completes the acquisition lifecycle leading to the user being able to write specifications with a focus on ESS requirements in this module. The logical next step for the participant is to consider modules in the testing life cycle, which are T101, T201, T202, T203, and T204 which lead up to the T313 module: Applying Your Test Plan to the Environmental Sensor Stations based on NTCIP 1204 Standard v04.
