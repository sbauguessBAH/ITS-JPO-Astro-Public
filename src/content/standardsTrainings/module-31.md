module: 31
code: "A315a"
title: "Understanding User Needs for ASC Based on NTCIP 1202 v03 Standard (Updated 2021)"
length: "1 hour, 18 minutes"

NTCIP 1202 v03, Object Definitions for Actuated Signal Controllers (ASC), was recently updated and published. This standard defines object to allow transportation professionals to monitor, configure, and control traffic signal controllers. Version 3 of the standard was developed using a Systems Engineering Process (SEP) and contains user needs, requirements, and design content.

The purpose of this updated module is to incorporate necessary changes made by the updated NTCIP standard v03 (from v02). This module provides participants with information on how to identify the appropriate use of the NTCIP 1202 v03 and acquire a traffic signal control system based on what the user is seeking to accomplish; and also provides participants with information on how to identify user needs that can be traced to requirements, which will be discussed in A315b: Understanding Requirements for Actuated Traffic Signal Controllers (ASC) Based on NTCIP 1202 Standard. This module helps the participant understand the interdependency of NTCIP 1202 objects to the architecture and functionality of NEMA TS2.

This module provides participants with information to understand the scope of the NTCIP 1202 v03 Standard, identifies the appropriate use of the Standard to acquire an Actuated Traffic Signal Controller or ASC system, and how to prepare (tailor) their ASC project specification based on the information provided by the Standard.
