The connected vehicles (CV), a component of the Cooperative Intelligent Transportation System (C-ITS) environment, has the potential to significantly reduce vehicular crashes, provide operators of surface transportation systems with more timely and accurate system performance data to better manage their systems, and provide travelers with access to specific traveler information. In order to achieve these benefits, it is essential that agencies use standards in deploying connected vehicle technologies to maximize the benefits from the connected vehicle environment. Proper deployment of standards will support interoperability, minimize future integration costs, make procurements easier, and facilitate regional and national integration.

The purpose of this module is to introduce the ISO TS 19091 specification and its relationship with other connected vehicle standards. This module will provide participants with an introduction to the ISO Technical Specification (TS) 19091, intelligent transport systems—Cooperative ITS—using V2I and V2V communications for applications related to signalized intersections. This module describes the structure of the specification, presents the use cases addressed by the specification, then introduces how to use the standard to deploy a standards-based application for signalized intersections. This module helps the participant understand the scope of the ISO TS 19091 specification and describes how implementers can use this specification to implement standards-based connected vehicle applications specific to signalized intersections.
