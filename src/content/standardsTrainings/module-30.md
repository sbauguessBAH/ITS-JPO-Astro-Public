code: "T321"
title: "Applying Your Test Plan to the TMDD Standard"
length: "2 hours, 6 minutes"

This module assists user agencies in creating a test plan specific to their TMDD v03 Standard based system interface. Prior to developing such a test plan, the user is expected to be knowledgeable of TMDD v03 Standard testing methodologies. This module will cover material related to elements of the TMDD Standard required to apply test plans to verify that an agency's product or system meets design specifications and other requirements of the TMDD Standard, while following standard testing methodologies discussed in the plan and in IEEE 829.

This module will cover the role of other modes of testing, including compliance, manufacturing, and acceptance tests, and verification and validation as part of the testing life cycle expressed in the "V" model.

This module will use a sample test plan for TMDD based on IEEE 829 to demonstrate the proper way to create a test plan specific to the user needs and requirements based on the DMS Standard, including test procedures. It will walk through the process of correctly creating a test plan.
