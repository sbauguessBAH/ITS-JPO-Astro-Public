The purpose of this module is to help users learn how to identify and prepare well-written user needs. This module also helps users understand the scope and application of the NTCIP 1207 v02 Standard as it addresses on-ramp flow control, and assist in identifying the operational and safety-related needs of an overall corridor traffic management.

This module (and the following module, A309b) focuses on the communications interface aspects—how to configure, monitor, and control ramp meters remotely from a Transportation Management Center (TMC) or locally at the front-panel—using data objects provided by the NTCIP 1207 v02 standard. It will provide participants with information on how to identify the appropriate use of the NTCIP 1207 v02 Standard and acquire ramp meter control (RMC) units based on what the user is seeking to accomplish.
