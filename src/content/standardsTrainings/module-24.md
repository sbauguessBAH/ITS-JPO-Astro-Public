This module provides participants with information on how to identify the user needs of Field Management Stations (FMS) and the appropriate use of the NTCIP 1210 Standard in acquiring a Signal System Masters (SSM) system. FMS user need identification is based on what the user is seeking to accomplish with support from tools and resources such as a Protocol Requirements List (PRL) in following a Systems Engineering (SE) Process.

This module helps the user understand the scope of FMS user needs within NTCIP 1210 SSM Standard and the ConOps it supports. This module is to be placed in the context of the SE-based standards as well as in the acquisition curriculum path with A304B: Specifying Requirements for Field Management Stations - Part 1 Object Definitions for Signal System Masters Based on NTCIP 1210 Standard following this module.
