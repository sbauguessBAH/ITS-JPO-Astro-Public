  <h2>Vehicle-to-Everything</h2>
  <p>
    Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) is the next generation of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). V2X technologies capture vehicle-generated traffic data, wirelessly providing information such
    as advisories from the infrastructure to the vehicle that inform the driver of safety, mobility, or environment-related conditions. State and local agencies are likely to install V2X
    infrastructure alongside or integrated with existing ITS equipment. Because of this, the majority of V2X deployments may qualify for similar federal-aid programs as ITS deployments, if the
    deploying agency meets certain eligibility requirements.
  </p>
  <p>
    This page lists a broad range of resources that help planners, transportation engineers, decision-makers, and other involved in the ITS deployment process with valuable information about V2X
    technologies.
