          The USDOT tested Dedicated Short-range Communications (DSRC) technology extensively over several years, including the impact of sharing the band with unlicensed devices, impact of out of band emissions (OOBE) and interference from unlicensed devices operating in adjacent channels.

          As a result of these activities, several technical reports were produced and made available to the public. You can find these reports on the Safety Band website.
