        <p class="read-more-wrap pt-0">V2X provides connectivity through both direct and network communication.</p>

        <p>Under <strong>direct V2X</strong>, vehicles exchange frequent, structured messages about relative speed, position and other relevant data directly from one system element to another (device-to-device). This form of communication ensures 360-degree awareness, even in situations with poor obstructed visibility, such as around corners or in dense fog.</p>

        <p>Alternatively, under <strong>network V2X</strong>, messages are transmitted through an intermediate network, such as traditional mobile networks, to get delivered to the end recipient.</p>

        <p>Direct V2X communication is suited for safety applications requiring low latency (e.g., crash avoidance scenarios), while network V2X communication, including digital alerts received on a mobile device, is more suited to carry information over longer distances (e.g., alerts about traffic and road conditions).</p>
