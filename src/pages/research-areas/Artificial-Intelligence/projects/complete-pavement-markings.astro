          <h3 class="blue">Project Objective & Overview</h3>
          <p>
            This project develops a LiDAR-based framework to automatically detect pavement marking locations and assess their conditions, including retroreflectivity. Pavement markings play a vital
            role in communicating safety-critical information, such as yield and stop control, to road users. When they fade or deteriorate, they can compromise public safety and expose transportation
            agencies to legal liability.
          </p>
          <p>
            To address this need, the project collected LiDAR data across approximately 210 miles of bike lanes in the Greater Boston area using vehicle-mounted, backpack/bike-mounted, and
            high-density airborne platforms. It also developed models for efficient point-cloud segmentation, pavement-marking extraction, and condition evaluation. All outputs were delivered in
            GIS-ready formats to support maintenance planning, asset management, and complete streets safety assessments.

          <ul>
            <li>Developed an automated LiDAR workflow for pavement marking detection, point-cloud segmentation, and retroreflectivity estimation.</li>
            <li>Utilized mobile, bike-mounted, and high-density airborne LiDAR to capture both fine-grained markings and corridor-wide features.</li>
            <li>Validated LiDAR-derived retroreflectivity against handheld measurements, confirming strong technical accuracy.</li>
            <li>
              NOAA LiDAR's low point density was insufficient for bike-lane markings. Mobile LiDAR provided the details needed for stencils and symbols but was sometimes hindered by traffic, parked
              vehicles, and access constraints.
            </li>
            <li>Identified high-density airborne LiDAR as a scalable solution for regional pavement-marking mapping.</li>
            <li>
              LiDAR platform selection requires a balance between resolution and coverage. A hybrid airborne–mobile approach may improve cost efficiency and data completeness in future deployments.
            </li>
            <li>The developed workflow can be expanded to extract additional complete-street assets.</li>
