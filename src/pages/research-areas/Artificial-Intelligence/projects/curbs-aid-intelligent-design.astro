          <ul>
            <li>Planning safer, more accessible streets requires significant time and expert effort.</li>
            <li>Analyzing pedestrian and traffic infrastructure across large areas is difficult with today's manual tools.</li>
            <li>Creating detailed, up-to-date maps of walkways and sidewalks at scale remains a challenge.</li>
            <li>Many existing transportation datasets are missing important pedestrian details, such as curbs and sidewalk conditions.</li>
          </ul>

              <p><strong>Proposed Approach</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Create an accurate digital traffic network that captures walkways, sidewalks, and their interactions using AI on overhead and ground-level imagery.</li>
                <li>Automate extraction of walkway networks from overhead imagery, enhanced with ground-level images for fine details like curbs and sidewalk conditions.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p class="mt-3"><strong>Phase I Key Findings and Challenges</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Walkway detectability:</strong> AI models detected sidewalks with 40% accuracy overall compared to OpenStreetMap data, reaching 75% in well-annotated areas. Some semantic segmentation models did not transfer well without domain-specific training.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Imagery resolution matters:</strong> Reliable detection requires overhead imagery of at least 12 in/px; performance drops sharply at lower resolutions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Ground imagery and LiDAR add value:</strong> Incorporating ground-level photos and LiDAR improves the quality of training and evaluation masks, providing better data than current crowd-sourced maps.
                </li>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Scale experimentation:</strong> Expand testing of walkway detection and AI models to six major metropolitan regions in the eastern United States.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Develop LLM-based planning assistant:</strong> Build an interactive tool that allows planners to query the pedestrian network, explore infrastructure data, and generate improvement suggestions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Engage with state and local DOTs:</strong> Collaborate with transportation agencies to understand how they would use AI-generated data and tools in real-world planning workflows.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Integrate multi-source data:</strong> Combine overhead imagery, ground-level photos, and LiDAR data to improve model accuracy and detail for large-scale deployment.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Enhance user interaction:</strong> Use web-based visualization tools to allow planners to see proposed changes, assess network conditions, and make data-driven decisions efficiently.
