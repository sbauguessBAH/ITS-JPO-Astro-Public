          <p class="EngangementPillRow">
            State, regional, local, and tribal transportation agencies are under increasing pressure to plan, design, and deliver projects that keep pace with rapid changes in population growth,
            freight movement, and infrastructure needs. Today's transportation data, ranging from traffic counts and freight flows to safety statistics and crash locations, is vast, complex, and often
            siloed across different systems, companies, and third-party resellers. Integrating these diverse datasets into clear, actionable insights remains a significant challenge, slowing planning
            processes and creating inefficiencies in project delivery.
          </p>
          <p class="EngangementPillRow">
            The AI for Transportation Planning and Design (AI TPD) initiative is a $15 million, multi-phase federal effort to address these gaps by bringing the power of artificial intelligence
            directly to transportation agencies. The initiative equips agencies with advanced AI tools to identify safety risks, detect network gaps, and automate aspects of planning and design. These
            capabilities allow agencies to simulate and compare design strategies, assess performance across modes and corridors, and improve safety outcomes system-wide. By streamlining data analysis
            and design evaluation, the initiative reduces the time and cost required to translate information into action, thus supporting safer, more efficient, and more resilient transportation
            networks.
          </p>
          <p class="EngangementPillRow">
            This effort is funded through the U.S. DOT Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which provides seed funding to promote early-stage research and development. Phase II and IIB
            outcomes rely on the specifications established in the initial solicitation. While the SBIR program is more structured than other funding mechanisms, it offers small businesses an
            opportunity to develop innovative methods that advance the state of practice. The phased approach allows promising ideas to mature, scale, and transition toward commercialization.

          Transportation agencies often face persistent data challenges: information is fragmented across jurisdictions, inconsistent in quality, and incomplete across modes. Reliable, real-time data
          on emerging systems, such as connected and automated vehicles (CAV), micromobility, and active transportation, is especially limited. These data gaps make it difficult to anticipate system
          needs, identify safety risks, or design coordinated, multimodal networks.
        </p>
        <p class="EngangementPillRow">
          The AI for Transportation Planning and Design (AI for TPD) initiative is exploring how artificial intelligence can transform how transportation data is gathered, cleaned, and integrated.
          Using computer vision, machine learning, and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, the program supports new methods to automatically extract information from diverse sources such as
          satellite and street-level imagery, LiDAR, sensor feeds, dashcam video, crowdsourced inputs, and vehicle probe data.
        </p>
        <p class="EngangementPillRow">
          AI algorithms can classify roadway elements, detect changes over time, and estimate travel behaviors at scales and speeds that are not feasible through manual analysis. These approaches
          improve data coverage, timeliness, and consistency, creating a stronger foundation for safety analysis, performance monitoring, and automated decision support. By building high-quality,
          continuously updated datasets, agencies can more effectively plan, evaluate, and maintain safer and more resilient transportation systems.

        <p class="EngangementPillRow">
          Building on improved data integration, the AI for TPD initiative is advancing new tools that use artificial intelligence and large language models (LLMs) to make transportation data easier
          to explore and apply. These tools will allow users to query complex datasets in natural language, asking questions such as "Where are the highest-risk pedestrian corridors?" or "How might
          proposed designs affect freight travel times?" and receive clear, visual responses.
        </p>
        <p class="EngangementPillRow">
          By combining AI analytics, geospatial visualization, and dynamic simulation, agencies can test scenarios, compare design options, and monitor performance across safety, mobility, and
          efficiency metrics. This reduces the need for manual data processing and specialized modeling, enabling faster, more transparent, and evidence-based decision-making across transportation
          networks.
