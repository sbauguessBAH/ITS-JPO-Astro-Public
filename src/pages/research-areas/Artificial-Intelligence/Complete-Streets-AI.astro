          The Complete Streets Artificial Intelligence Initiative is a multi-phase effort to develop a suite of powerful new decision support tools for state, local, and tribal transportation agencies
          that assist in the siting, design, and deployment of Complete Streets. The initiative is nested within U.S. DOTâ€™s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program. U.S. DOT anticipates
          funding small businesses for up to three phases of activity. These phases, in their entirety, will propel early-stage concepts out of research and development and into nation-wide products
          for public and private use.
