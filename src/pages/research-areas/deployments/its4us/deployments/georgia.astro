    Safe Trips in a Connected Transportation Network (ST-CTN) seeks to enhance the travel experience for underserved communities, including people with disabilities, older adults, and travelers with
    limited English proficiency. It will leverage innovative solutions and existing systems such as connected vehicle (CV) deployments, an advanced trip routing engine, and a regional trip planner -
    all developed within an open-sourced application called the Georgia Mobility and Accessibility Planner (G-MAP). The application will allow travelers to create a personalized trip plan to navigate
    physical infrastructure, resolve unexpected obstacles, and ensure visibility throughout their travel.
  </p>
  <p>
    The deployment pilot project is led by the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) with support from the Atlanta Regional Commission in Gwinnett County, Georgia, which is a suburban county
    northeast of Atlanta. The ST-CTN system will provide Gwinnett County travelers with detailed information and step-by-step navigation tailored for users’ specific needs along with a range of other
    features geared to improve trip efficiency and safety. This concept is comprised of an integrated set of advanced transportation technology solutions including CVs, transit signal priority,
    machine learning, and predictive analytics to support safe and complete trips.

    The ST-CTN project aims to upgrade and integrate existing technologies and services to assist underserved populations with completing their trip successfully, safely, and reliably. The vision of
    the project is to provide travelers with directions, conditions, and status on the links between trip legs that are personalized based on their preferences and capabilities, while connecting them
    to CV infrastructure to provide safer trips and greater transportation network awareness. The ST-CTN project includes the following key elements that will address identified stakeholder
    challenges:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Accessible Route Planning:</strong>
      <p>
        Comprehensive data collected on sidewalk conditions and the ability to customize trip preferences based on specific needs (e.g., sidewalk width, sidewalk slope, available elevators) will give
        users reliable trips and greater confidence.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Navigation:</strong>
      <p>
        Users will benefit from personalized navigation settings for hands-free and accessible options including haptic, voice, and text. Turn-by-turn directions will include building entrances and
        indoor navigation.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Safety:</strong>
      <p>
        Information flows between systems, which enables remote service requests to transit vehicles, information about intersection crossings and pedestrian crossing time extensions if needed, and
        alerts to CVs and users increasing traveler awareness.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="sideways blue">Measuring Deployment Impact</h2>
  <p>Some of the key performance goals and targets for ST-CTN include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Enhancing the traveler’s multimodal complete trip experience:</strong>
      <p>
        Enhancements include accessible ST-CTN system functions and features, enroute traveler support, and the ability for travelers to seamlessly transfer between modes while considering changes in
        routes due to unplanned events. Travel experience surveys, unique user logins, anonymized user data, and GCT complaints logs will be used to understand impact.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Enhancing safety:</strong>
      <p>
        The project aims to reduce transportation-related incidents, injuries, and near misses along pedestrian routes and at intersections; increase driver awareness of pedestrians; and improve
        pedestrian awareness of connected and emergency vehicles at intersections.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Improving mobility and accessibility:</strong>
      <p>
        Improvements include optimized transit schedules and travel times as part of TSP operations, traveler knowledge of accessible routes, automated actuation of walk phase requests, transit stop
        requests through travelers' mobile device or automated based on a traveler's planned route within the application, and identification of existing barriers for infrastructure enhancements.
