  <p class="read-more-wrap" style="padding-top: 0px">
    The ITS4US Deployment Program aims to address mobility challenges for all travelers. Building from the USDOT’s previous and ongoing foundational research work along with emerging technologies,
    practices, and other critical inputs gathered from various sources, the ITS4US Program is designed to bring publicly and privately sponsored research together to create large-scale, replicable
    deployments to address the challenges of planning and executing all segments of a trip for all travelers regardless of location, income, disability, employment, education, healthcare, and other
    factors.

  <h3>The Program Targets</h3>
  <p class="read-more-wrap" style="padding-top: 0px">
    For most of us, getting to work, to the store, or visiting family is as easy as getting in your vehicle and driving to your destination. Yet for some, these trips can be challenging and stressful,
    especially if some transportation options are unavailable or difficult to access.
  </p>

  <p class="read-more-wrap" style="padding-top: 0px">
    Underserved communities encounter these challenges. Including people with disabilities, older adults, low-income Individuals, rural residents, veterans, and limited English proficiency. Getting
    from place to place — being independently mobile — is important to everyone. Having a transportation system in place that is reliable and accessible to all travelers is necessary to help people
    get where they need to go, when they need to get there.
  </p>
  <p class="read-more-wrap" style="padding-top: 0px">
    The ITS4US project aims to solve these challenges by introducing technology solutions to these underserved communities by providing options and connecting different modes of transportation so
    individuals in these communities can travel from origin to destination without gaps in their travel chain.
  </p>

  

  <h3>The Program Response</h3>
  <p class="read-more-wrap" style="padding-top: 0px">
    In October 2019, USDOT announced $50 million in new initiatives to expand access to transportation for people with disabilities, older adults, and individuals of low income, including up to $40
    Million for the ITS4US Deployment Program to deploy a multimodal effort led by The Intelligent Transportations Systems Joint Program Office (ITS JPO) and supported by The Office of the Secretary
    (OST), The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), and The Federal Transit Administration (FTA). The ITS4US portfolio will identify ways to provide more efficient, affordable, and accessible
    transportation services with a focus for people in underserved communities that often face greater challenges in accessing essential services and to enable communities to showcase innovative
    business partnerships, technologies, and practices that promote independent mobility for all.
  </p>
  <p class="read-more-wrap" style="padding-top: 0px">
    This program will enable communities to build local partnerships, develop and deploy integrated and replicable mobility solutions to achieve multimodal cooperative trips supported by developing
    intelligent transportation systems.
