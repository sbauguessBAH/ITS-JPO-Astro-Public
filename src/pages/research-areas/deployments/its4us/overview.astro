  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p class="read-more-wrap" style="padding-top: 0px">
    The ITS4US Deployment Program aims to solve mobility challenges of all travelers, regardless of location, income, or disability, in accessing jobs, education, healthcare, and
    other activities.
  </p>
  <p>
    In October 2019, U.S. DOT announced $50 million in new initiatives to expand access to transportation for people with disabilities, older adults, and individuals of low income,
    including up to $40 Million for the ITS4US Deployment Program. The Complete Trip portfolio will identify ways to provide more efficient, affordable, and accessible transportation
    services for people with disabilities, older adults and other underserved communities that often face greater challenges in accessing essential services.
  </p>
  <p>
    As part of the Complete Trip Portfolio, the ITS4US Deployment Program is a multimodal effort let by the ITS JPO with support from OST, FTA, and FHWA. This program will make up to
    $40 million available to enable communities to showcase innovative business partnerships, technologies, and practices that promote independent mobility for all.
  </p>
  <p>
    Building from the U.S. DOTâ€™s previous and ongoing foundational research work in concert with emerging technologies, practices and other critical inputs gathered from all sources,
    the Program is designed to bring publicly and privately sponsored research together to create large-scale, replicable deployments to address the challenges of planning and
    executing all segments of a complete trip for all travelers regardless of location, income, or disability
  </p>

  <h3>Complete Trip Concept</h3>
  <p class="read-more-wrap" style="padding-top: 0px">
    The concept of a complete trip is that an individual can travel from origin to destination without gaps in the travel chain. A complete trip includes multiple links or trip
    segments. If one segment of the trip is inaccessible, unreliable, or inefficient, then the trip cannot be completed.
