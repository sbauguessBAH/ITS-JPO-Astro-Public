        THIS PAGE IS ALL POTENTIAL CONTENT THAT I AM THROWING ON. NOT SURE WHAT SHOULD BE INCLUDED IF ANYTHING. Will lay it out a bit better
        depending on what we actually want to include.

        Intersection Safety Systems (ISS) Prototype Deployment and Testing

            Building on the success of the Intersection Safety Challenge,
            the Intersection Safety Systems (ISS) program focuses on prototyping
            and demonstrating innovative intersection safety systems under real-world conditions.
            The goal is to develop full end-to-end prototype Intersection Safety Systems, including
            sensor fusion, AI-based decision-making, and conflict mitigation.

      <p>Should I include the graphic under here that's like the timeline, to show where in the process ths ISS prototypes are?</p>

        Key Research Questions
      </h2>
      <ol class="program-list">
        <li>
          Conflict Prediction Reliability and Speed: Can an ISS reliably predict conflicts early enough and fast enough to take mitigating actions? If no, which component(s) of the ISS require additional R&D to improve speed and reliability?  How much improvement is needed to implement potential mitigations (see below)?
        </li>
        <li>
          Mitigation Strategies and Effectiveness: Given ISS response speed, what are possible conflict mitigation strategies (e.g., warnings, prohibiting unprotected turns, others)? Which types of conflict mitigations (or combinations of mitigations) are most effective at preventing vulnerable road user-vehicle conflicts?
        </li>
        <li>
          ISS Cost Effectiveness: Which ISS components are most expensive? Can existing sensors be repurposed for use in an ISS? What are other strategies to reduce overall ISS costs? Can such a system be deployed cost-effectively today? Under what conditions and for which particular intersection geometries?
        </li>
        <li>
          ISS Potential for Broader Deployment: Given the current state of ISS technology, are narrow ISSs (e.g., for a specific ODD or use case) or a general-purpose ISS more practical for near-term deployment?
