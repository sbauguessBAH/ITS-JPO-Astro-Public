          <h3 class="blue">Project Objective & Overview</h3>
          <p>
            During Phase I, AIWaysion successfully developed, demonstrated, and validated a scalable, AI-powered system to support transportation planning and design (TPD) by automating the generation, processing, and integration of multimodal infrastructure, safety, and contextual datasets.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Phase I project's focus region was the City of Tucson, Arizona. The work was led by AIWaysion with technical collaboration from the University of Arizona's Center for Applied Transportation Sciences (CATS), and with support from the City of Tucson and guidance from FHWA program officials.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project aimed to address critical data gaps, enhance data fidelity and accuracy, and streamline decision-support analytics by leveraging AI and computer vision (CV) to analyze street-view imagery, satellite imagery, roadside camera feeds, and other data sources.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>TPD Data Collection Framework:</strong> Developed a robust, modular framework capable of aggregating GIS, satellite, street-view, and roadside camera/sensor feeds, enabling high-fidelity datasets.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>AI & CV Data Generation:</strong> Implemented advanced object detection and semantic segmentation models to extract roadway and infrastructure features such as sidewalks, crosswalks, bike lanes, signage, markings, control devices, surface conditions, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>TPD Copilot with Vision-Language Model (VLM):</strong> Applied VLM models to translate geospatial and visual inputs into actionable planning insights. A user interface has been built for prompt-driven query input and output interpretation using VLMs.
            </li>
          </ul>
