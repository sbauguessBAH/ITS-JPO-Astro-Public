          <p>
            Phase I demonstrated a scalable, low-cost approach to collecting street-level data and linking built environment conditions to travel behavior, without third-party data.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Designed, built, deployed, and operated a scalable, low-cost street-level data collection system to capture imagery at scale and enable nationwide scalability</li>
            <li>Fully re-architected our visual machine learning pipeline to extract infrastructure, context, and travel behavior features, transitioning to a zero-shot ensemble methodology</li>
            <li>Developed predictive models linking built environment features to travel behavior using data from a single deployment, enabling cost-effective, citywide travel behavior estimation</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mt-3" style="font-size: 0.9rem; font-style: italic;">
            <strong>Infrastructure</strong> = physical street assets; <strong>Context</strong> = land use and urban form/design; <strong>Travel behavior</strong> = pedestrian, bicycle, and vehicle activity.

          <h3 class="blue">Key Results & Findings</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Designed and deployed a data collection system using cell phones, collecting 2M+ images across 8,000+ unique blocks in the Philadelphia/SEPTA service area, demonstrating the feasibility of independent, scalable street-level imagery collection and eliminating reliance on third-party data sources</li>
            <li>Expanded built environment features from 127 to 150 fully re-architected feature extraction pipeline using a new 298-model zero-shot ensemble architecture, enabling block-level extraction of infrastructure, context, and travel behavior features</li>
            <li>Achieved strong and consistent model performance (≈90% unbalanced, 88% balanced accuracy, average) and developed predictive models linking built environment features to travel behavior, achieving r² ≈ 0.5+ for pedestrian and vehicle activity</li>
            <li>Demonstrated that one-time built environment data collection, combined with limited observed travel behavior data, can support citywide travel behavior estimation, providing a cost-effective alternative to sensor- and mobile phone–based approaches for large-area analysis</li>
            <li>Lessons learned: Phase I highlighted the need to further improve hardware robustness, incorporate additional data modalities, and refine software workflows to support repeated deployments and operational use at scale</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Co-develop ACES with pilot cities using design thinking to align hardware, analytics, and software with agency workflows</li>
            <li>Mature Raspberry Pi-based, modular, open-source hardware, building on prototype deployed and tested in Sacramento, CA (post Phase I), enabling city and/or State of Place-led deployments</li>
            <li>Deploy across five geographies (Charlotte; Syracuse MSA; San Diego; Kansas City region; Colorado Springs) with repeated, multi-season data collection</li>
            <li>Enhance feature extraction/forecasting, including multimodal sensing; optimize processing pipeline</li>
            <li>Integrate outputs into a decision-support platform for scenario testing, prioritization, and reporting (e.g., identifying where infrastructure changes most improve safety, access, or mode share)</li>
