      <p class="program-text">
        Driving automation is one of the major transportation industry trends 
        of this decade. Through close collaboration and monitoring of current industry 
        and academic technology innovators and leaders in automation the ITS JPO continues 
        the pursuit of an automation program that will support the safe deployment 
        of an automated future. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) with automation 
        of lateral or longitudinal controls are widely available in passenger vehicles, 
        although their development and refinement continue. Automated Driving System (ADS)-equipped 
        vehicles are being piloted in passenger vehicles, commercial motor vehicles, and transit buses. 
      </p>
      <p class="program-text">
        While driving automation research has been, to some degree, mainstreamed 
        across the Department's Operating Administrations, research needs are evolving 
        alongside the technology. The technological and practical challenges of translating 
        research breakthroughs into daily transportation are significant and often are not 
        fully understood at the outset. Many foundational questions around ADS 
        and ADAS may not be resolved until more and better data are available.

        The ITS JPO Automation Program's collaborative and multi-modal research portfolio
