        <p>
          Driving automation is one of the major transportation industry trends 
          of this decade. Through close collaboration and monitoring of current industry 
          and academic technology innovators and leaders in automation the ITS JPO continues 
          the pursuit of an automation program that will support the safe deployment 
          of an automated future. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) with automation 
          of lateral or longitudinal controls are widely available in passenger vehicles, 
          although their development and refinement continue. Automated Driving System (ADS)-equipped 
          vehicles are being piloted in passenger vehicles, commercial motor vehicles, and transit buses. 
        </p>
        <p>
          While driving automation research has been, to some degree, mainstreamed 
          across the Department's Operating Administrations, research needs are evolving 
          alongside the technology. The technological and practical challenges of translating 
          research breakthroughs into daily transportation are significant and often are not 
          fully understood at the outset. Many foundational questions around ADS 
          and ADAS may not be resolved until more and better data are available. 
          The ITS JPO Automation Program's collaborative and multi-modal research portfolio 
          provides cross-cutting support across the U.S. DOT with the following strategies:
