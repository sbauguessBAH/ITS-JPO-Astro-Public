        Accelerating V2X Cohort
      </h2>
      <p class="program-text">
        The Accelerating V2X Cohort is a collaborative initiative by the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) 
        Joint Program Office (JPO) to support public agencies and other infrastructure owners and operators (IOOs) 
        in accelerating the deployment of interoperable vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies. These technologies 
        are critical to creating a modern, world-class transportation system that improves safety, efficiency, 
        and reliability through seamless wireless connectivity among vehicles, mobile devices, and smart infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p class="program-text">
        The cohort is designed to accelerate the deployment of V2X technologies by fostering a community of practice 
        among V2X deployers. Participating public entities have the opportunity to share their experiences, challenges, 
        and best practices in planning and deploying V2X technologies.
      </p>
      <p class="program-text">
        Through monthly virtual meetings, cohort members collaborate to discuss emerging topics and to collaborate 
        on addressing technical questions to support the successful, interoperable deployment of connected 
        transportation technologies. U.S. DOT provides facilitation, technical support, and access to resources 
        to assist participants in achieving their project objectives.
