            The Mobility on Demand (MOD) Peer Exchange Series, hosted by the U.S. Department 
            of Transportation (USDOT), facilitated interactive dialogues that brought together 
            stakeholders to discuss key, targeted topics that impact MOD deployment and adoption.

          <p class="program-text">
            This series aimed to support state-of-the-industry knowledge sharing 
            regarding topic-specific needs and lessons learned, as well as opportunities 
            for growth to advance MOD as a tool to support mobility and efficiency. 
            These virtual peer exchanges featured presentations by subject matter experts 
            and opportunities for attendees to engage with these experts as well 
            as other peers in the space.
