      <p class="program-text">
        Queue warning systems (QWS) help improve roadway safety and traffic flow 
        by providing real-time alerts on downstream congestion. They reduce crash risks 
        and travel times by giving drivers early warnings and allowing them to react, 
        find alternate routes, and minimize sudden braking. 
      </p>
      <p class="program-text">
        The U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) hosts Queue Warning Peer Exchanges 
        to connect State DOTs, share best practices, explore challenges, 
        support future deployments, and communicate findings. Experts present on key topics 
        like planning, design, operations, maintenance, and evaluation, fostering collaboration 
        and knowledge-sharing among transportation professionals.
