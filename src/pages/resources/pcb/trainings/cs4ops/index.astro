        Crowdsourcing for Operations
      </h2>
      <p class="program-text">
        Most public agencies and private companies use crowdsourcing, which is the practice of addressing 
        a need or a problem by enlisting the services of large numbers of people through technology. 
        Organizations crowdsource product reviews, idea generation, feature detection, funding, and much more. 
        With the proliferation of location-based technologies, an unprecedented wave of crowdsourced data 
        is available to transportation agencies. Moreover, analytics tools and services make processing 
        and using crowdsourced data a true game-changer for advancing intelligent transportation systems (ITS) 
        solutions and <Link isExternal href="https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/tsmo/">transportation systems management and operations (TSMO)</Link>.

        <Link isExternal href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/innovation/everydaycounts/edc_6/crowdsourcing.cfm">Crowdsourcing for Advancing Operations</Link>, 
        has been supporting the adoption of crowdsourced data and tools to advance transportation operations 
        across 35+ States and their local agencies to improve traffic incident, road weather, work zone, 
        traffic signal, traveler information and emergency management, along with a host of other ITS and TSMO practices.
