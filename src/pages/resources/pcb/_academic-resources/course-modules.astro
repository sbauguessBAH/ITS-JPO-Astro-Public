        ITS provide promising solutions for improving traffic safety and mobility in 
        the transportation network. Educating future transportation professionals 
        about ITS ensures they are equipped to think critically and develop novel approaches 
        for the most pressing transportation issues and needs. ITS academic course modules aim 
        to advance knowledge of ITS for college and university students. An ITS academic 
        course module is a freestanding class (or component) of a course that provides structure 
        to students' learning through organized learning content. Each course module would focus 
        on a specific ITS theme, concept, or technology. Instructor and student materials focused 
        on ensuring an engaging experience supporting the course module outcomes in the structure 
        of 90 minutes of instruction are anticipated to be provided 
        for each course module and include:
