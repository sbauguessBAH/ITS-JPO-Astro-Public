	<div class="typography">
		<p>
			The U.S. DOT established the ITS Standards Program in 1996 to encourage the widespread use of ITS technologies in our
			Nation's surface transportation systems. ITS standards exist within technologies deployed under the framework of the
			<a href={base_url("/resources/asc/reference-architecture")}>National ITS Reference Architecture, also known as "ARC-IT"</a> and 
			define how system components interconnect and interact. Because ITS standards are based on open, non-proprietary technology, 
			their use can facilitate the deployment of interoperable ITS systems and make it easier for state and local ITS deployers 
			to develop and deploy regionally integrated transportation systems.
		</p>
		<p>
			The ITS Standards Program is teaming with standards development organizations (SDOs) and industry groups to facilitate
			the development and testing of consensus-based standards, protocols, and specifications to enable the exchange and
			interpretation of data; while working with state and local highway and transit agencies on standards-based ITS
			implementation strategies.

		<h3 class="mt-4">INTEROPERABILITY</h3>
		<p>
			The ability of different ITS devices and components to exchange and interpret data directly through a common
			communications interface, and to use the exchanged data to operate together effectively, is called <strong><em>interoperability</em></strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Interoperability is key to achieving the full potential of ITS. Seamless data exchange would allow an emergency services
			vehicle to notify a traffic management center to trigger a change in the timing of the traffic signals on the path to a
			hospital, in order to assist the responding ambulance. A standards-based approach to integration helps to facilitate the
			exchange of transportation data as well as more easily accommodate future equipment replacements, systems upgrades,
			and system expansions.

	<StandardsHeading title="What are Standards"/>
	<div class="typography">
		<p>
			Standards define an architecture of interrelated systems that work together to deliver transportation services. An ITS
			architecture defines how systems functionally operate and the interconnection of information exchanges that must take
			place between these systems to accomplish transportation services. An architecture is functionally oriented and not
			technology-specific which allows the architecture to remain effective over time. It defines "what must be done," not
			"how it will be done.“
		</p>
		<p>
			Most standards are voluntary, consensus-based, and open:
			<ul>
				<li>Voluntary, meaning their use is not mandated by law</li>
				<li>Consensus-based, meaning that a published standard has attained general agreement through cooperation and
					compromise in a process that is inclusive of all interested parties</li>
				<li>Open, meaning that they are not proprietary and are available for anyone to use</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			The use of standards encourages industry growth by minimizing development costs, increasing compatibility and
			interoperability, and increasing buyer and seller confidence in products. It is important to note that ITS standards are
			not design standards: They do not specify specific products or designs to use. Instead, the use of standards
			gives transportation agencies confidence that components from different manufacturers will work together, without
			removing the incentive for designers and manufacturers to compete to provide products that are more efficient or offer
			more features.

	<StandardsHeading title="Standards Development Activities"/>
	<div class="typography">
		<p>
			The ITS JPO undertakes a range of activities to support standards development and use:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Developing standards</strong> &mdash; through cooperative agreements with SDOs and organizations &mdash; for both existing ITS
					technologies and ITS Standards Focus Areas. The program is also active in international efforts to harmonize ITS
					standards and architecture to increase commonality of connected vehicle technologies across multiple regions.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Coordinate with SDOs</strong> to promote cooperation and achieve consensus-based standards, increasing interoperability
					and adoption by deployers. Provide input when needed to inform the appropriate working groups in of
					improvements, modifications, or changes needed in standards related to the demonstration, deployment, and testing
					of the standards.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Testing standards</strong> in actual transportation settings (through field testing by state and local transportation agencies).
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Providing technical assistance</strong> to state and local ITS deployers (through ITS Specialists at FHWA Resource Centers and
					through the <a href="https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/int_its_deployment/standards_imp/stdsteam.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ITS Field Support Team</a>.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Delivering ITS standards training</strong> and workshops through the ITS Professional Capacity Building Program and industry
					partners.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Developing experience-based</strong> deployment guidance and tools such as lessons learned.
				</li>
				<li>
					To request member/observer status in standard working groups (WG) please follow the links above and query the
					WG POC specifically.
				</li>
