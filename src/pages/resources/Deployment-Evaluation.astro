    <p>
      This Program addresses stakeholder needs through the full ITS deployment lifecycle and provides information to assist communities with making evidence-based decisions on ITS investment,
      deployment, and performance assessment.&nbsp; A central objective of the DEP is to determine the extent, effectiveness, and benefits/costs of deployed ITS and, ultimately, the value/return on
      investment of ITS program interventions and deployment support activities. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Evaluation and deployment tracking activities are critical to an understanding of the value, effectiveness, and impacts
      of the ITS Program activities in alignment with U.S. DOT goals. <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title23-section515&num=0&edition=prelim">
      23 USC Sect 515</a> paragraph (g) outlines the requirement to maintain a repository for technical and safety data collected as a result of the federal projects carried out
      under the ITS program and the ITS Benefits, Costs, and Lessons Learned (BCLL) Database, created in 1999, does that by tracking and documenting the effectiveness of deployed ITS.
