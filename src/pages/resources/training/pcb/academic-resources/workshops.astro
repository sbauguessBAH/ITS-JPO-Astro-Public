      The ITS PCB team hosted workshops with faculty from universities, community colleges, and technical institutions, 
      as well as public, private, and professional organization representatives. The purpose of these workshops was 
      to identify strategies for incorporating ITS education into school curricula and to gather vital feedback 
      for the ITS JPO to develop new tools to advance ITS learning.
