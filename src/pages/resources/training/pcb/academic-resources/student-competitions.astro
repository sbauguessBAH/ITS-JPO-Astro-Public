    <h2>ITS Student Competitions</h2>
    <p>
      ITS PCB Program and the National Operations Center of Excellence (NOCoE) developed a student competition, 
      the Transportation Technology Tournament (TTT) to assist ITS students in working directly with public agencies 
      to solve real-world transportation problems utilizing ITS and TSMO solutions. The competition allows student teams 
      to leverage their experience, education, and ITS PCB materials to develop a solution or suite of solutions 
      to directly address the transportation problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      A detailed description of the TTT, its deadlines, and a list of the student teams participating 
      is available at <Link href="https://transportationops.org/transportation-technology-tournament" isExternal>https://transportationops.org/transportation-technology-tournament</Link>.
