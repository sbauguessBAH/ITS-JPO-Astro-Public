    <h2>Equipment and Loan Desk</h2>
    <p>
      The USDOT's Connected and Automated Vehicle Support Services provide infrastructure owner operators (IOOs), equipment manufacturers, 
      and device vendors with technical assistance and equipment loans during connected and automated vehicle (CAV) deployments. 
      By providing knowledge and equipment, the services advance CAV deployments without any cost for users. 
      Support services are provided to all levels of users, including IOOs interested in testing CAV technologies as they consider deployment, 
      vendors interested in bench testing time and space at the Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center (TFHRC), 
      and organizations in the later stages of CAV deployment, such as the Connected Vehicle Pilot Sites.

            Connected and Automated Vehicle Education (CAVe)-In-a-Box â€“ CAVe-in-a-box 
            is a hands-on learning experience to aid curriculum, and support instruction 
            for community colleges and trade schools, facilitate benchmarking 
            connected vehicle equipment, and support onboarding of ITS technicians. 
            The toolkit features two prototype designs for roadside and in-vehicle installations 
            as well as a detailed system design document for configuration and deployment.
