          CAVe-in-a-box, short for connected and automated vehicle education in a box, offers a comprehensive, hands-on learning experience
          designed to enhance curricula at community colleges and trade schools. It supports instructors in teaching intelligent transportation
          system concepts, helps benchmark connected vehicle equipment, and streamlines onboarding for intelligent transportation system technicians.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Each kit includes a complete infrastructure setup and onboard equipment, featuring transportation radios, networking devices,
          traffic control equipment, and software. With SAVe-in-a-box, educators can train, deploy, and test scaled intelligent transportation
          systems directly in the classroom, providing students with practical real-world experience.

    <!-- <p>
      Connected and Automated Vehicle education (CAVe) seeks to provide community colleges, trade schools, universities, 
      and other academic stakeholders with unique tools and resources for the development of an intelligent transportation workforce.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ITS PCB Program offers the following CAVe educational resources:
    </p>
    <h3>
      Connected and Automated Vehicle Education (CAVe)-in-a-box Hands-On Learning
    </h3>
    <p>
      CAVe-in-a-box is a hands-on learning experience to aid curriculum, and support instruction for community colleges 
      and trade schools, facilitate benchmarking connected vehicle equipment, and support onboarding of ITS technicians. 
      The CAVe-in-a-box infrastructure and onboard kits are equipped with all of the necessary transportation radios, 
      networking equipment, traffic control devices, and software to train, deploy, and test 
      a scaled intelligent transportation system in your classroom.
    </p>
    <h3>CAVe-in-a-box System Design Document</h3>
    <p>
      The Connected and Automated Vehicle Education (CAVe)-in-a-box System Design Document (April 2022; PDF HTML) provides setup 
      and software configuration guides for original connected vehicle (CV) test tools. The document also serves as a valuable resource 
      to gain an understanding of how intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are designed. The System Design Document:
      <ul>
        <li>Introduces CAVe-in-a-box as a technical tool for education purposes.</li>
        <li>Provides detailed documentation of all aspects related to CAVe-in-a-box, from required electrical and mechanical components to physical connections.</li>
        <li>Provides information on software requirements for the kit, including testing and debugging.</li>
        <li>Provides hands-on use cases and examples related to CAVe-in-a-box.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      To learn more about how you can bring CAVe-in-a-box to your curriculum, email <Link href="mailto:CAVSupportServices@dot.gov" isExternal>CAVSupportServices@dot.gov</Link>
    </p>
    <h3>CAVe-in-a-box Do It Yourself (DIY) Instructions</h3>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Build your own CAVe-in-a-box from scratch.</li>
        <li>Learn to setup and configure your own CAVe-in-a-box toolkit</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>The CAVe-in-a-box Training Video Series</h3>
    <p>
      The CAVe-in-a-box training video series is a compendium to the one-of-a-kind intelligent transportation training tool 
      that can supplement curriculum with dynamic hands-on instructional videos. This series covers everything 
      from vehicle radio configuration, installation, and mounting to data flows in a full deployed transportation management system. 
      By following along with the series and reading the CAVe-in-a-box system design document, you will be ready to deploy CAVe-in-a-box 
      in a classroom setting. The July 2021 videos cover the following topics:
