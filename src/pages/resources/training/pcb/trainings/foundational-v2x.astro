      <p>
        Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) is the use of wireless communications technologies to enable vehicles 
        to communicate with each other, other road users such as pedestrians and bicyclists, and infrastructure. 
        These technologies have the potential to make significant impacts improving safety, enhancing mobility, 
        and reducing transportation's environmental impact. This foundational-level course provides participants 
        with a basic understanding of V2X concepts. Participants are introduced to the key components 
        that enable a V2X ecosystem, the potential benefits of the technology, and example use cases and the messages 
        and standards supporting them while ensuring safety and privacy. This 4-hour introductory course 
        is currently be offered in collaboration with ITS America to ITS State Chapters&mdash;as well as others&mdash;
        across the United States. Entities interested in this training should reach out 
        to J.D. Schneeberger (<Link isExternal href="mailto:john.schneeberger@dot.gov">john.schneeberger@dot.gov</Link>).
