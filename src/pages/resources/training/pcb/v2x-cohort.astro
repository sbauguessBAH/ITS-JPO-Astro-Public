    <p>
      The Accelerating V2X Cohort is a collaborative initiative to bring together public agencies as they advance the deployment of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies. The cohort allows state DOTs, local agencies, and other infrastructure owners and operators (IOOs) to share their experiences, challenges, and best practices as they deploy this technology to enhance safety and improve efficiency. This community of practice offers a platform for peer learning and collaboration to ensure successful and interoperable V2X deployments across the nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through virtual meetings, members discuss topics such as concept planning, design, procurement, testing, deployment, 
      and maintenance, facilitated by the U.S. DOT providing technical support and resources. The initiative offers a platform for peer learning and collaboration to ensure 
      that V2X deployments deliver on their intended safety and efficiency goals.

      Organizations interested in joining the cohort should contact the ITS PCB Program.
