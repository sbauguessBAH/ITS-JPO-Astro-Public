          The ITS Professional Capacity Building (PCB) Program is the U.S. Department of Transportation's primary mechanism 
          for educating the transportation workforce about ITS and emerging transportation technologies. The Program provides training 
          and technical assistance by delivering in-person and web-based trainings, peer exchanges, cohorts, 
          educational resources, and other tools.
