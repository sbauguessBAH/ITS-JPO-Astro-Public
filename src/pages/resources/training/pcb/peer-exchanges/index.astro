  <h2>Peer Exchanges</h2>
  <p>
    The Peer Exchange program connects ITS practitioners with a specific area of expertise with other practitioners 
    needing assistance in that area. The U.S. DOT facilitate knowledge transfer to address ITS and V2X planning, 
    deployment and operational challenges. These exchanges may take the form of in-person or virtual exchanges either on or off-site.
