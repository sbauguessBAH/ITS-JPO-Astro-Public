      <h3>Work Zone Data Exchange (WZDx)</h3>
      <p>
        The Work Zone Data Exchange (WZDx) enables infrastructure owner/operators (IOOs) to make harmonized work zone data available for third party use. The IOOs and work zone equipment
        vendors use the WZDx Specification to share data about work zone events and connected devices in work zones with data consumers in an effort to make travel on public roads safer and
        more efficient through ubiquitous access to data on work zone activity. Development of such data exchange specifications also aim to get data on work zones into vehicles to help
        automated driving systems (ADS) and human drivers navigate more safely. The Work Zone Data Working Group released version 4.2 of the WZDx Specification in February 2023 as the final
        version before proceeding to a systems engineering based standardization process.

      <h3>Connected Work Zones (CWZ)</h3>
      <p>
        WZDx v4.2 is the last version created under the Work Zone Data Working Group governance structure. The specification is being standardized by ITE (with partners AASHTO and NEMA) and
        SAE. Connected Work Zones Standard Implementation (CWZ Standard) effort aims to develop, publish, verify, and validate a CWZ Standard that defines the data elements, capabilities, and
        interfaces a connected work zone must support to ensure interoperability for state/local infrastructure owner/operators (IOO) and vehicle operators. A connected work zone is defined as
        a set of technologies that generates or collects work zone information (whether automatically or manually) as well as the infrastructure that broadcasts/distributes this information to
        the public and to vehicles.

      <h3>Data Exchanges for Managing Disruptions</h3>
      <p>
        The Data Exchanges for Managing Disruptions enables research, demonstration, and deployment of Transportation Systems Management and Operations (TSMO) Strategies by developing data
        specifications and standards for consistent and accurate real-time data feeds between different assets of infrastructure owner/operators (IOOs), drivers, connected and automated
        vehicles, infrastructure, TMCs, mapping tools, etc. These exchanges aim to support diverse transportation management goals around disruption through the use of shared data. The Data
        Exchanges for Managing Disruptions project also aims to support a community-driven process to develop a cohesive operational framework for a data exchange aimed at managing disruptions
        to operations, referred to as MDODE. This conceptual framework will establish a common understanding of essential data to be collected and shared among systems and user communities.
        The project will create a cohesive data environment where both situational awareness and accurate history of disruptive events will be housed.

          <h4>How can access to data enable safe, efficient, and accessible integration of automated vehicles into the transportation system?</h4>
          <p class="read-more-wrap">
            Access to harmonized data is essential to the integration of automated vehicles and other emerging ITS areas that are highly data dependent. As vehicles and travelers cross
            jurisdictional boundaries, data exchanges are a key component and are crucial for the next generation of interoperable transportation. Lack of access to data could impede connected
            and automated vehicle integration and delay their safe introduction. The <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/av/data/wzdx">Work Zone Data Exchange (WZDx)</a> is an example of a voluntary
            data exchange that aims to get data on work zones into vehicles to help automated driving systems and human drivers navigate more safely.

          <h4>Who is the target audience of the Data Exchanges for Managing Disruptions effort?</h4>
          <p class="read-more-wrap">Managing Disruptions will incorporate the interests of an array of user groups, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Data system managers (e.g., public or private organizations, universities)</li>
            <li>
              Data contributors (e.g., TMC operators, traveling public using mobile apps, dispatchers for emergency services and fleet operations, transit providers, work zone managers, road
              weather managers within transportation agencies)
            </li>
            <li>
              Data users (e.g., news media, traveling public, information service providers in mobile apps, maintenance and operations, transportation planners and designers, TMC operators,
              researchers)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>What is the first step towards developing data specifications and standards?</h4>
          <p class="read-more-wrap">
            U.S. DOT will convene a working group of public-private partners who will meet regularly to identify needs and iteratively develop a specification to communicate information about
            roadway disruptions to third parties in a uniform manner.
          </p>
