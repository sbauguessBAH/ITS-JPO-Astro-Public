        In recent years, integration of data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques became inevitably important in developing ITS solutions, thus putting AI in the forefront of ITS and transportation research. ITS Data Program supports research activities to promote use, reuse, and repurposing of ITS data, especially using advanced computing technologies, analytics, and methods such as Machine Learning (ML).

      <p>
        This research demonstrates the intersection of data and AI with a primary objective of supporting new AI-focused test datasets and techniques to promote future development of transportation solutions that are data and AI-centric. The research project also focuses on demonstrating research-to-operations possibilities by identifying and prioritizing research problems, identifying potential solutions using available data and AI techniques, and rapidly investigating/testing the feasibility of such solutions by limited demonstrations.
