       <h2>United States Department of Transportation Report to Congress</h2>
       <h3>The Department of Transportation&rsquo;s Responses to the  Recommendations of the ITS Program Advisory Committee</h3>
       <p>Section 5305(h) of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU, P.L. 109-59) directs the Department to establish an Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) Program Advisory Committee (ITS PAC). The purpose of the ITS PAC is to provide advice to the Secretary of Transportation on the scope and direction of the Department&rsquo;s ITS Program, by providing input into the development of the ITS aspects of the Department&rsquo;s strategic plan and reviewing the ITS research being considered for funding. The Department is also directed to submit an annual report to Congress in February of each year which includes:
       </p>
       <ul class="ritafont">
         <li>
           All recommendations made by the Advisory Committee during the preceding calendar year;</li>
         <li>An explanation of how the Secretary has implemented those recommendations; and</li>
         <li>For recommendations not implemented, the reasons for rejecting the recommendations.
           
         </li>
       </ul>
       <p>The  ITS PAC has met four times since its inception.&nbsp;  These meetings have focused on strategic planning activities and program  reviews that will be critical for the next phase of the ITS Program.&nbsp; The first meeting of the Committee, on  September 25, 2007, was held via web conference and provided basic information  to committee members on the role and responsibilities of the ITS PAC (including  a review of the SAFETEA-LU legislation and Federal Advisory Committee Act  [FACA] procedures), information on conflicts of interest, and an initial  overview of the Department&rsquo;s ITS program.&nbsp;  The second meeting was held on November 26-27, 2007, at the Department&rsquo;s  headquarters.&nbsp; This meeting provided the  Committee members with more detailed information on the Department&rsquo;s ITS  Program and also presented initial information on the ITS Program&rsquo;s initial  strategic planning efforts and processes.&nbsp;  After this meeting, the Chair and Vice Chair were nominated; these  individuals then presided over the third meeting of the ITS PAC.</p>
       <p>The  third meeting of the ITS PAC, held on March 13, 2008, provided more detailed  information to the Committee on the ITS Joint Program Office&rsquo;s (ITS JPO)  strategic planning efforts and solicited specific input on the proposed future  mission, goals and focus areas of the ITS JPO.&nbsp;  As a result of this meeting, the ITS PAC made its first formal recommendations  to guide the future strategic direction of the Department&rsquo;s ITS program (<em>Advice Memorandum Number 1, </em>dated May  29, 2008).&nbsp; The fourth meeting of the ITS  PAC, held on July 31-August 1, 2008, focused on continued review of the JPO&rsquo;s  current ITS research program with the objective of soliciting from the ITS PAC  input on the following, which is required under SAFETEA-LU Section  5305(h)(3)(B):</p>
       <ul class="ritafont">
         <li>Whether current research activities are likely  to advance either the state-of-the-practice or state-of-the-art in intelligent  transportation systems;</li>
         <li>Whether the intelligent transportation system  technologies are likely to be deployed by users, and if not, to determine the  barriers to deployment; and</li>
         <li>The appropriate roles for government and the  private sector in investing in the research and technologies being  considered.&nbsp;</li>
       </ul>
       <p>Input  from this fourth meeting of the ITS PAC resulted in the second set of formal  recommendations from the committee (<em>Advice  Memorandum Number 2</em>, dated October 31, 2008).</p>
       <p>Below are the Department&rsquo;s responses to  the ITS PAC&rsquo;s suggestions and recommendations.</p>
       <h3>Response to the  ITS Program Advisory Committee (ITS PAC) Advice Memorandum No. 1 (May 29, 2008)</h3>
<p>The ITS JPO reviewed the <em>ITS  Program Advisory Committee (ITS PAC) Advice Memorandum Number 1 (May 29, 2008) </em>and  has already taken action on the recommendations of the ITS PAC as presented in  this first Advice Memorandum<em>. </em></p>
<p>Since receiving the first Advice Memorandum from the committee  and reviewing the initial set of the recommendations based on results of  activities undertaken at the meeting in March, 2008, the ITS JPO worked  diligently to address several specific recommendations of the ITS PAC.&nbsp; Many of the recommendations made in this  first Memorandum from the ITS PAC reflected specific information requests made  by the ITS PAC in order for them to provide informed, sound advice to the  Department during subsequent meetings and deliberations.&nbsp; As such, the ITS JPO responded to these  information requests made in the first Advice Memorandum by devoting specific  agenda items during its July 31-August 1, 2008, meeting to address information  needs and issues that the ITS PAC considered critical in order to move forward.  These agenda items included:</p>
<ul class="ritafont">
  <li>Information       on Department activities at the ITS World Congress (held in New York City in       November 2008), focusing on VII-related activities.</li>
  <li>Information       on outreach activities undertaken by the ITS JPO with respect to the       University Transportation Centers (UTC) Program.</li>
  <li>Information       on how the proposed new goals and focus areas of the ITS JPO&rsquo;s research       program link to research initiatives currently underway.</li>
  <li>Detailed       budget information.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ITS PAC also made several recommendations about the future  direction of the ITS research program and related ITS JPO activities.&nbsp; In response to these recommendations, the ITS  JPO is currently undertaking a strategic revisioning process with respect to  areas of research focus in the coming years.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Below are the Department&rsquo;s responses to the ITS PAC  recommendations in the first Advice Memorandum.</p>
<h4>Rules of Engagement</h4>
<p>The ITS PAC proposed to provide  independent advice to the ITS JPO via written outputs after each meeting, which  will constitute the advice of the ITS PAC.&nbsp;  The ITS JPO agreed with this recommendation, and has received two Advice  Memoranda from the ITS PAC, both of which are addressed in this Report to  Congress.&nbsp; Both Advice Memoranda were  transmitted to the RITA Administrator.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The ITS PAC also proposed to take a broad view of ITS, bring  a &ldquo;systems approach&rdquo; to its deliberations, and focus on the Federal role in the  overall ITS area.&nbsp; The ITS PAC proposed  to approach the ITS from both individual surface modes and  intermodal/multimodal perspectives.&nbsp; The  ITS PAC also indicated that it views the goals of the ITS Program as  multidimensional and noted that the goals as proposed by the ITS JPO reflect  vital national transportation priorities and the wide-ranging nature of ITS  with respect to a variety of political, social, and deployment issues.&nbsp; The Department fully supports the manner in  which the ITS PAC plans to approach the nature of its counsel and believes such  approaches are vital to the success of the ITS Program.</p>
<p>Finally, the ITS PAC suggested adding an additional  programmatic goal &ndash; <em>ITS-Enabled Universal  Access to the U.S. Transportation System</em>.&nbsp;  This new proposed programmatic goal addresses issues of social equity  and sustainability.&nbsp; The Department  recognizes this as an important issue and, as the ITS JPO continues to engage  in its strategic re-envisioning process, will work with the Modes to address  this additional goal for the ITS Program.&nbsp; </p>
<h4>Further Cross-Cutting Comments on  the Program</h4>
<p>The ITS PAC requested more specific information on what  activities the Department would be undertaking for the ITS World Congress in New York City in November,  2008.&nbsp; The Department provided this  information at the July 2008 ITS PAC meeting.</p>
<p>The ITS PAC suggested that the Department, through the ITS  JPO, reach out to the UTCs to suggest ITS-related research.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Department agrees with this  recommendation and the <br />
  ITS JPO has met with the Department&rsquo;s UTC director.&nbsp; The Department had identified several opportunities  for increased cooperation and the JPO staff has begun to coordinate more  closely with the UTCs.&nbsp; Also, this topic  was made an agenda item at the ITS PAC meeting in July 2008 and the ITS PAC was  given an update on the Department&rsquo;s activities in this area. Additionally, the  ITS JPO has a staff vacancy that should be filled in the summer of 2009.&nbsp; Part of this person&rsquo;s responsibilities will  be to ensure increased coordination with UTCs, per the recommendation of the  ITS PAC.</p>
<p>The ITS PAC suggested that the Department, through the ITS  JPO, provide a better understanding of how the proposed new ITS Program  research goals and focus areas linked to current programs.&nbsp; The ITS JPO devoted an agenda item at the ITS  PAC meeting in July and provided this information (see attached).&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>The ITS PAC suggested that ways of creating public  acceptance and support for the ITS should be discussed at subsequent  meetings.&nbsp; The Department agrees that  this is an important topic to continually revisit.&nbsp; This topic was included in the ITS research  reviews during the ITS PAC&rsquo;s July 2008 meeting.</p>
<p>The ITS PAC requested additional, more detailed information  on the ITS Program budget elements.&nbsp; The  Department provided the ITS PAC with detailed budgetary information at the July  2008 meeting.</p>
<p>The ITS PAC recommended that there be a better balance  between supply-side and demand-side research in the ITS Program.&nbsp;The Department believes this balance is  important in order for ITS research to benefit the entire nation.</p>
<p>The ITS PAC suggested that the Department engage in broad  based technology scanning to yield insight into future research and technology  opportunities and collect information on organizational ITS deployment models  worldwide.&nbsp; The Department, through the  ITS JPO, is initiating a technology scanning effort.&nbsp; This work is planned for award in winter  2009.</p>
<h3>Response to the  ITS Program Advisory Committee (ITS PAC) Advice Memorandum No. 2 (October 31,  2008)</h3>
<p>The  fourth meeting of the ITS PAC was held July 31-August 1, 2008.&nbsp; The objectives of the meeting were threefold:  1) respond to the information requests made by the ITS PAC in Advice Memorandum  Number 1; 2) specifically address the ITS JPO&rsquo;s revised and changing  programmatic goals; and 3) have the ITS JPO provide a status report/update on  the ITS Program&rsquo;s current research initiatives.</p>
<p>Therefore,  the second Advice Memorandum from the ITS PAC devoted considerable attention to  the goals of the program.</p>
<h4>Future Research</h4>
<p>The  ITS PAC recognized that many of the ITS JPO&rsquo;s current research initiatives were  moving toward conclusion and that the ITS Program itself was planning to  undergo a transition with respect to its research goals and priorities.&nbsp; The ITS PAC indicated its intent to give  useful advice on shaping the future of the program and, in particular, address  the question of gaps, or what the Committee called &ldquo;white space,&rdquo; in the  research program.&nbsp; The ITS PAC noted some  particular examples of &ldquo;white space,&rdquo; including: system management, the ITS and  the environment, transportation network management, the application of an  overall engineering systems approach to the ITS, and the development of  algorithms for network management.&nbsp; The  Department welcomes the ITS PAC&rsquo;s efforts to identify areas of new research and  agrees that the <br />
  above-mentioned  examples are strong candidates for further exploration and examination.</p>
<p>The  ITS PAC also commented that it will be important for the Department to better  understand the institutional barriers to more extensive ITS deployment, and  noted that, for example, reducing congestion by using the ITS more extensively  and effectively is not necessarily a technology issue but may be, in large  part, an issue of overcoming institutional barriers and hurdles.&nbsp; The Department concurs with this statement,  and agrees that the ITS research program should clearly reflect the need to  address institutional barriers to the ITS deployment.&nbsp; The <br />
  ITS  JPO has since restructured the office and now provides a clear organizational  role for technology transfer of which addressing institutional issues is a key  part.</p>
<p>The ITS PAC also pointed out that as the reauthorization  of SAFETEA-LU approaches, it is critical to address these issues and have the  ITS fit properly into the goals and priorities of the new legislation.&nbsp; The Department concurs, and the ITS JPO has  initiated efforts to develop a coordinated set of the ITS principles for  reauthorization consideration by the new administration.</p>
       <h4>USDOT Role in the ITS Research and  Development</h4>
       <p>The  ITS PAC is clear in its call for the Department and the ITS JPO to take on  critical leadership roles in the future of ITS as facilitators, coordinators,  and shapers of the ITS program, working closely with partners in the states and  in the private sector.&nbsp; The Department  agrees that clear Federal leadership is necessary as we move the ITS research  program into the future. &nbsp;To this end,  the ITS JPO has accomplished or is currently executing the following:</p>
       <ul class="ritafont">
         <li>Published  the ITS Program Plan and summaries of current research results for each of the  major research initiatives;</li>
         <li>Developing  reauthorization principles for the ITS;</li>
         <li>Developing  a charter and processes for internal multi-modal coordination;</li>
         <li>Rebranded  the Vehicle Infrastructure Integration (VII) program to IntelliDriveSM;  and</li>
         <li>Developing  coordinated IntelliDriveSM principles in order to lead and stabilize  the working relationship with the key stakeholders.       </li>
       </ul>
       <p>The  Department looks forward to working with the ITS PAC to further cement this  leadership role.&nbsp; </p>
       <h4><em>The New York City ITS World Congress</em></h4>
       <p>The  ITS PAC commented on the importance of presenting valuable demonstrations of <br />
         U.S.-based  ITS technologies and systems at global events such as the annual ITS World  Congress, and that properly packaging these demonstrations for the media is of  great importance.&nbsp; The Department concurs  that the U.S.  ITS industry needs to be well-represented at any ITS World Congress. ITS America  played the lead role in developing demonstrations of the ITS technologies at  the New York World Congress. The Department notes, however, the legislative  limitation on the expenditure of the ITS funds for displays, outreach and  public relations.&nbsp; Consequently, the  USDOT participated through displaying a large booth, providing publications and  offering numerous presentations.</p>
       <h4><em>Linkage to University Transportation  Centers Program</em></h4>
       <p>The  ITS PAC reiterated its interest in having the Department, through the ITS JPO,  work more closely with the University Transportation Centers (UTC) program  within the Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA) and noted  that, while the ITS JPO has been working to build those linkages, it would urge  the ITS JPO to expand and extend those efforts.&nbsp;  The Department concurs with these recommendations, and the ITS JPO will  continue its efforts to build these valuable partnerships, particularly once  the position is filled within the JPO, as the role&rsquo;s responsibilities include  interactiong with the UTCs.</p>
       <h4><em>Committee Views on the Goals of the  JPO&rsquo;s ITS Research Program</em></h4>
       <p>During  the July 31-August 1, 2008, ITS PAC meeting, there was extensive discussion  about a white paper that articulated the then-RITA Administrator&rsquo;s proposed  safety goal for the ITS research program.&nbsp;  The ITS PAC agreed that emphasizing a single goal provides programmatic  focus and clarity, and that safety appears to the committee to be an  appropriate goal on which to focus.&nbsp;  However, the ITS PAC also noted that it had previously recommended that  the Department employ a systems approach to the ITS, as the ITS research  program is multidimensional.&nbsp; The ITS PAC  noted that success with other goals will often contribute to safety as well,  such as reduction of congestion. The Department concurs that clarity of focus  is critical for the implementation of a multidimensional research program, and  also concurs that safety is just one appropriate goal on which to focus. The  Department notes that the ITS JPO began a strategic planning process in 2007  and engaged the ITS PAC in that process. It resulted in the identification of  the following focus areas:</p>
       <ul class="ritafont">
         <li>Safety  (Intelligent Vehicle);</li>
         <li>Mobility  (Real-Time Data, Integrated Electronic Payments);</li>
         <li>Environment  and Energy; and</li>
         <li>21st  Century Partnerships.       </li>
       </ul>
       <p>Based  on the input from the ITS PAC, the ITS JPO intends to revisit the strategic  planning process and focus areas in collaboration with the modal  administrations, including discussion of the new goal (see below), as  recommended by the ITS PAC.</p>
       <p><em>Additional  Goal:&nbsp; The ITS-Enables Universal Access  to the U.S.  Transportation System</em></p>
       <p>In  addition to the JPO&rsquo;s stated goals of mobility, safety, the environment, and 21st  century partnerships, the ITS PAC recommended an additional programmatic  goal:&nbsp; &ldquo;ITS-Enabled Universal Access to  the U.S. Transportation System.&rdquo;&nbsp; The  proposed focus area under this goal was to &ldquo;conduct research on and enable  deployment of means by which all citizens can access the full mobility and  information benefits of the US  transportation system through ITS technologies.&rdquo;&nbsp; The ITS PAC recommended that, while focusing  on the safety goal is appropriate, other important program objectives should be  acknowledged and treated explicitly, even if within the framework of the safety  objectives.</p>
       <p>The  Department concurs that a clearly-focused ITS research program is critical, and  also that the ITS research program must remain multidimensional.&nbsp; While safety is clearly a key area for the  Department in which ITS can have a significant impact, the ITS can also have an  impact in the Department&rsquo;s goal areas of congestion, environment, and global  connectivity.&nbsp; In addition, the  Department fully supports multimodal transportation options and services for  all citizens through the use of the ITS so that all Americans have a full range  of transportation and mobility choices available to them.&nbsp; The ITS JPO expects to have further  discussion with the ITS PAC to more fully understand what work areas are intended  to support a goal to enable universal access to the transportation system.</p>
       <p>The  ITS PAC also specifically recommended that the ITS program establish  quantifiable performance metrics for other programmatic research goals and  measure research program performance over time.&nbsp;  The ITS PAC cited an example of greenhouse gas emissions where goals  could be defined, in coordination with other agencies, such as the Department  of Energy, and addressed with recent findings in ITS technologies which may  yield significant benefits in fuel economy and emissions reductions.&nbsp; In addition, the ITS PAC recommended that  RITA validate the achievability of the safety goal by:</p>
       <ul class="ritafont">
         <li>Breaking  down the goal into the various ITS technologies with the potential for reducing  crashes and their contributions to achieving the overall goal;</li>
         <li>Identifying  needed Research and Development (R&amp;D);</li>
         <li>Preparing  a timeline for development and field deployment with interim goals to reach the  goal;</li>
         <li>Pursuing  a top-down systems engineering approach to the analysis of the goal;</li>
         <li>Innovating  a package of technologies and research techniques available to attack the goal;  and</li>
         <li>Developing  individual programs to help move this goal toward reality.       </li>
       </ul>
       <p>The  Department concurs with the need to establish and define quantifiable goals and  performance metrics for each dimension of the ITS research program.&nbsp; The ITS JPO intends to prepare a detailed  strategic plan for the future of the ITS research program, coordinate this  strategic plan with its modal partners and promote leadership through the ITS  Strategic Planning Group (SPG) and the ITS Management Council. Additionally,  the ITS JPO will work with these groups to develop highly specific,  supportable, and quantifiable performance metrics for future goal areas.</p>
       <p><em>Commentary  on Reaching the Safety Goal</em></p>
       <p>The  ITS PAC recommended that, while pursuing the safety goal, the Department, and  the ITS JPO, recognize that a large percentage of crashes are due to driver  error, and that driver behavior would need to be addressed as this goal is  approached through research.&nbsp; The ITS PAC  stressed that a large-scale reduction on highway fatalities would only be truly  feasible if research were conducted that addressed the concept of creating a  &ldquo;vehicle that cannot crash.&rdquo;&nbsp; The ITS PAC  described four &ldquo;domains&rdquo; to an ITS-enabled 360-degree awareness car:</p>
       <ul class="ritafont">
         <li>Domain  1: within the car (technologies and data sources that help monitor driver  behavior);</li>
         <li>Domain  2:&nbsp; line of sight (sensors allowing a  vehicle to sense objects and conditions around it);</li>
         <li>Domain  3:&nbsp; static far field (sensors and maps  that provide information on the road ahead); and</li>
         <li>Domain  4:&nbsp; dynamic far field (sensors and  systems that provide information on changing conditions on the road ahead).       </li>
       </ul>
       <p>The  ITS PAC recommended that these four domains about the car be addressed in a  seamless, highly integrated, and complementary fashion in order to accomplish  the goal.</p>
       <p>The  Department concurs that driver behavior in response to events inside and  outside of the vehicle is a significant contributor to road crashes.&nbsp; While, as the ITS PAC indicated, the ITS JPO  is addressing some, but not all, of these four domains, the Department also  recognizes that further work needs to be done in order to address the safety goal  in an integrated manner.&nbsp; The National  Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the Federal Highway  Administration (FHWA), and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration  (FMCSA) are currently conducting research into driver behavior issues and the  Department, through the ITS JPO, expects to more fully engage the NHTSA, the  FHWA, and the FMCSA in order to leverage research activities and results to  reduce roadway crashes. The ITS JPO, the NHTSA, the FHWA, and the FMCSA are  currently developing a work program for such research as part of the  IntelliDriveSM program.&nbsp; It is  expected that driver behavior will be a component of that research program.</p>
       <p><em>The  Ideal Federal Role in Reaching the Safety Goal</em></p>
       <p>The  ITS PAC was very clear in its recommendation that the ITS JPO, and the  Department, must provide leadership across all safety domains where ITS could  have an impact, regardless of whether the source of the technology is private  or public.&nbsp; The ITS PAC emphasized that  the Department consider all tools that can maximize the chances of success in  developing and deploying the ITS technologies that create &ldquo;cars that can&rsquo;t  crash&rdquo; and thereby achieving the bold safety goal articulated by RITA.</p>
       <p>The  Department concurs with these recommendations.&nbsp;  The Department agrees that it must play a leadership role in working  with the private and public sectors in developing and executing a research plan  that addresses the full range of activities to fulfill the Department&rsquo;s  commitment to safety. </p>
       <p><em>Recommendations  on the Current ITS Research Program</em></p>
       <p>On the second day of the meeting, the ITS PAC undertook a  high-level review of current programs and projects, fulfilling the requirements  of SAFETEA-LU in this area.&nbsp; The ITS JPO  asked for the ITS PAC input on the following three questions for each of its  research initiatives:</p>
       <ul  class="ritafont" start="1" type="1">
         <li>Are       these current and future activities likely to advance either the       state-of-the-practice or state-of-the-art in intelligent transportation       systems?</li>
       </ul>
      
       <ul  class="ritafont" start="2" type="1">
         <li>Are       the technologies being researched and tested likely to be deployed by       users?&nbsp; If not, what are the       barriers to deployment?</li>
       </ul>
       <ul  class="ritafont" start="3" type="1">
         <li>What       are the appropriate roles for government and the private sector in       investing in these existing and future research and technologies being       considered?       </li>
       </ul>
       <p>Below  are the ITS PAC comments, suggestions, and recommendations, along with the  Department&rsquo;s responses.</p>
       <h3>Next Generation 9-1-1</h3>
       <ul class="ritafont">
         <li>Advance  Either State-of-the-Practice or State-of-the-Art?       </li>
       </ul>

           <li>The  ITS PAC commented that deployment will depend heavily on buy-in by the State  and local governments.&nbsp; The ITS PAC  believes that the requirement for local funding to upgrade PSAPs is a  significant barrier and could result in a patchwork, so it may therefore be  prudent for the Department to develop some kind of funding and program of  Federal grants based on the size of jurisdiction or other criteria. The Enhanced  9-1-1 Act of 2004 authorized the creation of a National 9-1-1 Office with  responsibilities for a grant program to benefit local and state 9-1-1  authorities. A total of $43.5 million has been appropriated to the FHWA, the  NHTSA, and the NTIA to date and the National 9-1-1 Office targets summer of  2009 to make awards.&nbsp; The National 9-1-1  Office is a joint program office (NHTSA &amp; NTIA), but is housed within the  EMS Office of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration within the  Department.&nbsp; The NG9-1-1 Initiative will  transition to the National 9-1-1 Office at its completion.</li>

           <li>The  ITS PAC expressed that it had some difficulty assessing this since it only saw  a narrow piece of the total program.&nbsp; The  ITS PAC believed that it appeared to be application of existing technology,  however, and that there may be a need for standardization of technology when  implementing these features.&nbsp; The  Department concurs. Critical to the effective support of emergency  transportation operations, whether managing a single incident or responding to  the needs of a mass evacuation, is the ability to rapidly obtain, assess, and  share reliable and accurate real time data. The Department realizes that  innovative application of the existing ITS technologies, in addition to the future  development of technologies to obtain and appropriately act upon such  information is essential to effective transportation management decisions. One  recent Emergency Transportation Operations project specifically addressed  standardization of information exchange technologies between transportation  officials and public safety agencies. However, consideration is being given to  further efforts toward standardization of technologies, processes, and  performance requirements to allow for the rapid collection and seamless  exchange of accurate, reliable information. </li>

Many states have expanses of rural critical corridor  routes which are without instrumentation. This impacts the ability to detect  and respond to incidents, monitor evacuations, or hazardous materials  incidents, and increases the risk to emergency responders.</li>

           <li>The  ITS PAC commented that focusing on rural issues is a good Federal role, but  this initiative needs follow-up to encourage or subsidize deployment. The  Department agrees with this statement.&nbsp; Follow-up will include wide  distribution of results which would provide information for jurisdictions to  make better decisions when faced with data that would support interventions  similar to those implemented at the award sites. The Department notes that the  deployment of all ITS technologies remains a considerable challenge.&nbsp; Per legislation, the ITS investments are  eligible for the use of Federal funds.&nbsp;  The choice to deploy the ITS remains with the State and local  jurisdictions.&nbsp; Therefore, the ITS JPO  and modal administrations provide information about the value of ITS and how to  effectively deploy it in order to encourage State and local investment.</li>

The ITS PAC also indicated that these technologies can        also support time-distance-place based pricing of road use which promises        to reduce accidents, congestion, greenhouse gases, and other        pollution.&nbsp; The Department concurs        that the IVBSS program may accelerate deployment of similar systems.</li>

           <li>The        ITS PAC commented that, while this program does not appear to be        advancing the state-of-the-art specifically, the Department&rsquo;s leadership        is significant with respect to demonstrating proof-of-concept and        dedicating frequency spectrum for this application.&nbsp; However, with        the evolution of this concept to involve private telecommunication        networks in addition to DSRC, the ITS PAC believes that state-of-the-art        is clearly in the private sector.&nbsp; The Department disagrees that the        VII program is not advancing the state-of-the-art. From both a hardware        and software perspective, the VII program developed the first        multi-channel DSRC-based radios for both the vehicle and        infrastructure.&nbsp; While the fundamental technology is based upon        commercially available Wi-Fi technology, the integration of the entire        package is a new technology that enables the VII capability, including        new security algorithms that have no precedent.&nbsp; As a result of        program activities (and with program support), new standards are being        developed to encourage industry adoption. &nbsp;These standards include        the communications protocol (IEEE 802.11p), the security function (IEEE        1609) and the message sets (SAE J2735). &nbsp;From an applications        standpoint, the Department believes that the VII is advancing the        state-of-the-art as well.&nbsp; The various applications that are being        tested and evaluated are not ones that currently exist today,        particularly in the area of safety. &nbsp;This evaluation includes both        vehicle-to-vehicle safety as well as vehicle-to-infrastructure        applications. &nbsp;While these applications are not market ready        end-user applications, they have been developed for engineering        development and evaluation purposes and do break new ground in        demonstrating advanced capability for safety.&nbsp; Similarly, the DSRC        technology is a substantial enabler for mobility and pricing based        services. &nbsp;Recently completed in Michigan, the proof of concept testing        demonstrated the ability of the DSRC technology to support the basic        functionality necessary to support safety, mobility, and commercial        services. &nbsp;The Department agrees that the state-of-the-art for private telecommunications  networks is in the private sector. &nbsp;The government research program is  currently examining the potential benefits of moving towards a more open  architecture that leverages additional technologies besides just DSRC as  commercially available networks. </li>

However,        once we have more complete data from the current IVBSS, V2V, and V2I        projects, this may be an area for further consideration.       </li>

Further, the ITS PAC commented that the United        States is facing urgent problems of transportation system financing,        greenhouse gas emissions, traffic safety, and congestion which the        universal VII system deployment could help address. The ITS PAC        recommended that the Department should prioritize a meeting of key stakeholders        in this area to develop a national strategy for universal deployment of        basic VII systems as needed to support effective time-distance-place        based road pricing and system management, smart transit system        management, real-time traveler information systems, and other VII        applications across the nation in the coming decade.&nbsp; The Department, under the auspices of        the VII program, is looking at how to address safety, mobility, payment        services, and environmental issues.&nbsp; The Department is working with        key stakeholder groups that include vehicle manufacturers and public        transportation agencies to define viable deployment models.&nbsp; In        addition, the Department is encouraging discussions to include other        interested industries such as aftermarket suppliers and telecoms.&nbsp;        As part of the architecture update effort, the Department has increased        outreach efforts as a part of the research process to ensure adequate        engagement of the necessary stakeholders. The Department is also        expanding the list of use cases that the architecture structure needs to        be able to accommodate&nbsp; both system        performance measures and road pricing.</li>

    <li>The        ITS PAC commented that, as implemented by the Bush Administration, the        program primarily has aimed to foster implementation of bundled        strategies that simultaneously better manage, operate, and price existing        road capacity while supporting improved public transportation options. By        using a competitive incentive funding grant strategy, the initiative has        spurred dozens of cities to advance proposals for such activities, with        funding awarded to the most promising sites for near-term deployment. The        ITS PAC believes this is a useful model to spur innovation and should be        replicated in other USDOT program activities.&nbsp; The Department concurs.&nbsp; This approach is used frequently by the        ITS program and has been effective in broadening the involvement of        jurisdictions.&nbsp; For example, the        Integrated Corridor Management (ICM) and the Mobility Services for All        Americans (MSAA) programs both used competitive solicitations to engage        agencies to become involved in the ITS activities.</li>

    <li>The  ITS PAC commented that the integration of the Government with the private  sector is an appropriate government role but it should be integrated with private  sector solutions for components of the problem as well. The ITS PAC believes  that USDOT and Congress should consider strategies to foster more performance-based  funding and performance-based contracting initiatives that improve upon the  model established by the Urban Partnership Program and Congestion Reduction  Pilot Program elements of the USDOT Congestion Initiative.

    <li>The        ITS PAC commented that this program is focused on advancing an integrated        set of best practice techniques into deployment in a number of regions,        documenting performance and lessons retained. The ITS PAC also commented        that the general approaches from these pilot sites could be much more        widely deployed in the future, with appropriate efforts to encourage and        disseminate these approaches.&nbsp; The        Department concurs with these comments, and would also add that this        initiative is consistent with the ITS PAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the ITS        research program focus on systems engineering and network        management.&nbsp; The ICM initiative        centers on multimodal network management and follows specific systems        engineering processes.&nbsp; The        initiative began with the creation of a generic concept of operations and        implementation guide, based on systems engineering best practices.&nbsp; The initiative has applied these best        practices at eight sites, and placed most of the site-oriented concepts        of operation on the ITS JPO&rsquo;s website.&nbsp;        At the end of the ICM initiative, there will have been developed        sample concepts of operations, lessons learned documents, and specific        guidance regarding the implementation of the ICM based on a systems        engineering process.</li>

    <li>The        ITS PAC believes that this project appears to bring existing technology        to these groups who don't have it currently; that it appears to be more        of an administrative issue of managing vertical and horizontal activities        within government; that there is duplication in transportation services        provided by different social service agencies; and that this project        seeks to coordinate these services for much higher efficiency of        transportation service delivery.&nbsp;        The Department agrees with the Committee&rsquo;s assessment.</li>

  <ul type="circle">
    <li>The        ITS PAC commented that there is a possibility for much more widespread        deployment beyond the pilot sites, but this is likely only if there are        clear requirements for social service transportation agencies to        coordinate services. Such requirements could be created by Congressional        or executive agency actions. Such coordination would improve the        efficiency the of use of limited funds and foster reduced dependence on        imported oil, reduce pollution, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Department concurs and notes that        other cities are observing the progress of the MSAA sites in the hopes of        replicating the results.&nbsp; This step        is a positive outcome emphasizing the premise that the MSAA was intended        to develop replicable models. In addition, the Federal Interagency United        We Ride (UWR) initiative, with which the MSAA initiative collaborates        closely and in response to a Presidential executive order, continues to        bring all Federal human service transportation agencies together to        create favorable regulatory and institutional environments and provide        necessary guidance to encourage State and local coordination        actions.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br clear="all" />

<ul class="ritafont">
  <ul type="circle">
    <li>The        ITS PAC believes that this is an appropriate role, and that it is        important to call on various government-funded social service and health        agencies to better coordinate services and to hold them accountable for        deployment of these coordination technologies and their success.&nbsp; The Department agrees that this is an        appropriate role for the Federal government. In the spirit of collaboration and cooperation,        the UWR initiative provides a series of tools and useful resources to        assist human service transportation stakeholders to conduct performance        assessment and planning for service enhancement through coordination and        technology integration.</li>

    <li>The ITS PAC believes that        this project appears to be an application of existing technology.&nbsp; The Department concurs; however, while        the EFM Initiative was developed using existing technology, the        application of this technology was unique and government facilitation was        the cornerstone to progress.&nbsp; The        private sector identified the information transfer attendant to the        physical movement of goods as an area where they had particular        difficulty and where public private collaboration could significantly        improve the efficiency of goods movement. Also, the EFM Initiative delivered        a new non-proprietary, open-platform, web-based tool for freight        tracking.&nbsp; Due to the open-platform nature of        the EFM system, the tool is accessible to and inexpensive for any        businesses and shippers in the United States or abroad to        configure and connect with supply chain partners. </li>

    <li>The        ITS PAC commented that the EFM system deployment is most likely by        private industry and that the Federal Government needs a clear exit        strategy for this project.&nbsp; The        Department concurs and notes that, with the positive results of the        deployment test in hand, the project is now poised to advance the        adoption and integration of the EFM system and technology applications        into supply chain management.&nbsp; The        exit strategy is three-pronged.&nbsp;        First, the Department intends to utilize a metropolitan region&rsquo;s        economic development function to champion the EFM within their community        and to improve the efficiencies of freight movement through the region. Second, the Department        intends to energize several value-added service providers to        advance the EFM.&nbsp; Third, the Department        intends to work with a consortium of public-private market leaders,        including governmental shippers such as the Department of Defense,        Department of Energy, Environmental          Protection Agency, U.S.        Postal Service, Department of Commerce, and the European Union,&nbsp; to ensure interoperability of        transportation data standards between public and private entities.&nbsp; In addition, this adoption strategy        will be worked through numerous case studies that will document the        outcome of working with these groups.&nbsp;        The case studies will show all startup costs and compare them to        traditional information transfer start up costs, demonstrate how improved        data sharing efficiency will save money for businesses and the        transportation community, and provide the Department with a timeline for        how these entities will commercialize the EFM as the final step to the        Department&rsquo;s exit.</li>

    <li>The ITS PAC indicated that attention to commercial        transportation needs is important, so the government&rsquo;s leadership here is        warranted.&nbsp; However, the ITS PAC        also indicated that the government needs a defined exit strategy.&nbsp; The Department agrees and is providing leadership and pursuing the        exit strategy as defined above.</li>
